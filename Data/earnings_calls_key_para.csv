A_182167 2021-02-17 Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points to our overall growth. Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021. Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas. Now, let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by BioTek, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG. Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our MassHunter LC/MS software. This new software enables data integrity consisting important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICP-MS System, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables. Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double-digit, aided by COVID-19-related qPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business. As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical food businesses led the way, both growing strong double-digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market. Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The academia end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month. In addition, we're making progress on our qPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame. I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent One of America's Most Sustainable Companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company. When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished, all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results. Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we’re building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continues to deliver. Our M&A funnel is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win. As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we have the right team to continue to succeed. As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down. We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan of margin expansion at 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks. I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3%, while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter, albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens, while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation. We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. We're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines. The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. Environmental and forensics grew double-digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs. Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications, primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LC/MS. The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021. On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth, while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter. Our top-line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was [309 million] shares, as expected. Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- one-time tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our Annual Investor Event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or qPCR COVID assay in the outlook. As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the Investor Event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year. Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Thanks, Bob. Jason, if you can provide the instructions for Q&A, please.
A_182167 2021-02-17 [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Congratulation here on the preannouncement. On that note, Mike, actually, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what drove the delta to the preannouncement. And then importantly, on sustainability, it sounds like you're not really calling out any kind of pull forward here. Curious as we think about it, and particularly that biopharma strength and the mid-teens growth you’ve had in LC/MS, how are you thinking about the sustainability there?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Well, first of all, Tycho, thanks for the recognition. Really proud of the performance to even top our earlier revised expectations for the quarter. And I'd say that as we got into January, business in January was stronger than we had anticipated. And I think it was -- from a geographic perspective, we saw the strength in China. Obviously, that was higher than we had. We're thinking as long as very -- really good strength in the Americas, led by pharma and the food market. I'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about the food market, which is both growth in China as well as in Americas. And then no pull forwards. So it was a clean quarter with January being stronger than we had anticipated, when we already had announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. Bob, I don't know if I missed anything on the...
A_182167 2021-02-17 No. You got it.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And on the LC/MS strength, up mid-teens, certainly better numbers than we're seeing from a lot of your peers. Can you just talk to that?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I think that it's a continuation of story that's been underway for several quarters. We've continued to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings, coupled with our approach to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customer needs us most. We're getting the business. And it's very clear that not only is it a -- was there -- we saw, particularly in some of the pharma and non-COVID areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital had allocated for 2020, we got all that business, but it's more than that. It was a market share gain story as well for us. So I think it was a combination of a backtrack of investment by the pharma world but also our ability to gain share. And Bob, I know you've taken a close look at this and...
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I think, Tycho, to Mike's point, I think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio and our offerings to our customers. I think one things that we've seen is our responsiveness continues to improve, and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen. And as Mike said, as the year-end CapEx spending happened, we were there, and I think we took more than our fair share. And we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. Mike talked about the investment in the MassHunter software, which I think is going to really help continue this momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint, and it's an area of focus, and we're very excited about the biopharma business going forward.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And there's a real holistic story here as well. You know the story already Tycho with our ACG business complementing, on the services and consumables complementing what we can do on leading innovative instrument solutions.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And before I hop off, just one on ACG, you grew mid-20s in China off a low-teens comp. So it's not like the bar was low. Are you doing anything there structurally to kind of drive that acceleration?
A_182167 2021-02-17 What -- I'm going to let Padraig talk a little bit about that. Padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on that?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think it's a combination of our scale on our service business in China and our connection with customers. And also, we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities in China, which is really seeing a lot of pull-through from the customers and all markets are really driving the business forward, and we see it sustaining over the next period.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, Tycho, just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, this is an area where we've also increased our investments in people on the street. And as we think about, Mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing revenue into service contracts, this is an area where we've had a specific focus in China there, and it's really helped us. And so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in China.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Maybe, Mike, could you elaborate on your comment as far as beginning to see some improved activity in the C&E market? And maybe, Bob, could you give us some color on instruments versus aftermarket growth in the first quarter?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, we're really talking about order activity, right? So we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field teams, particularly in the area what I would call high-value chemicals, specialty chemicals. So there's a lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now. And I think our customers are feeling more confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming quarters. And as you know, this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been deferred. And we're seeing -- continue to see strong PMIs. But as you heard me share the story forward, Brandon, I'm always reluctant to call a turn until we actually see a couple of quarters. So while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready to yet to put it into the formal guide for the year.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And just on the second part of your question, Brandon, our instrumentation was roughly flat, and ACG was up mid-single-digits.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Then one follow-up for you, Bob. Gross margins in the first quarter were better. Do we expect that -- are you still thinking that the full year is still relatively flat to down? And any chance you could quantify the impact of the NASD capacity built on gross margin in the first quarter?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. It was a little lower than what -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we continue to ramp up. So it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter. If you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year, and that really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. And in terms of the overall year, I would say we're slightly more optimistic, kind of given where, certainly, the first quarter came in. And that's part of the increasing our top end, I would say, the margin expansion. It's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating expenses.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.
A_182167 2021-02-17 I guess for my first one, Mike, the guidance here, I guess Q2, your comps are pretty easy. You just did 11 in Q1. Could you perhaps comment on the Q2 and why that should step down? And when you look at the annual from an end market perspective, if C&E didn't change, I guess, is this biopharma that's changing for the annual outlook?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike, Vijay. Thanks for the acknowledgment. Yes, I'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter. If we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the regions that we see the uptake. And we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet putting it into the forecast. It's still at the end of the quarter. As Mike said, we're seeing a lot of business activity. We're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into orders and then ultimately into revenue. So everything there is moving in the right direction, and we would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year. If I look at Q2, we did have a higher-than-expected budget -- year-end budget dynamic that helped, obviously, the 11%. That doesn't repeat itself in Q2. And -- but if you looked at -- we feel very confident about the continued momentum of the business going forward.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And that was probably a couple of points of growth maybe.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. It's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yes.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Understood. And then I guess, just for my follow-up. Is the guide assuming, this COVID tailwinds that you mentioned 200 basis points in Q1, is that going to sustain? And I'm curious, what is driving the margin strength here, I guess, relative to your prior guide?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. So I'll take the first one. Yes. So we're still in that 2 percentage kind of revenue range for COVID. So that's a good number to lock into.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And I think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume. And I think that, that -- when we have that strong growth, you actually see it going to the bottom-line. When you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we were reflecting the pandemic and so forth. If we think about Q1 to Q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And Vijay, I'm sure you had a chance to look at Jacob's margins for the first quarter, but LSAG had very strong margins. And that's -- when you have double-digit growth in LC, the strength in the cell analysis business, we had indicated when we acquired BioTek that we are buying not only high growth but also a high-margin company, I think you're seeing it in the numbers.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVBL.
A_182167 2021-02-17 So my first question is on China, which you alluded to a little bit before. Obviously, a strong quarter, but just walk us through where do we stand today in China food and where the products are resonating? What's your outlook here? Obviously, this has been a market that has been improving for you after some disruptions a while ago. And just want to get a sense of where it stands and how should we think about it going forward?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, Puneet, thanks for your kind comments. And I'll make some initial introduction comments here about China food, and I'll invite Jacob into this conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here. So this is a quick remind to the audience. You may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of over 2 years in the China food market as a result of the reorganization of the China food ministries, and we always have been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national level. And now that situation has completely changed, which are -- there's reinvestment going into new technologies at the national level. In addition too, the testing volumes continue to grow for the contract testing lab side, picking up that volume. And Jacob, I think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, certainly, Mike. So you're right that we are seeing a broad-based interest from our portfolio. But particularly, what stands out is our triple quad, both the LC/MS and the GC/MS, which is sought after, especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used. And what we have developed here is one workflow, one sample press that can be used for both technologies. So that is very much better performance versus many others where you have to have 2 different kinds of setups. So we see a lot of interest in that. And so the triple quad is really paving the way right now.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And Jacob invested in a China solution center as well. So we actually, again, based on these leading technology platforms, are able to tailor our solutions for that China food market. So we're really excited about the change in the business volume there, as you can imagine.
A_182167 2021-02-17 That's great. And if I could also ask in terms of pharma in China, could you maybe just elaborate your positioning there? You had really strong growth here in terms of both small molecules and biomolecules as well. Maybe just if you could characterize that, is that biomarker growth largely coming from NASD? Is that what's driving that part of the component? And the small molecules, you had really strong growth, too, so maybe if you could parse that out.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. Specific to China, there's no NASD volume at all. It's zero in China. So that's purely on the -- on what we call the LSS side, which is ACG and LSAG business.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And I was going to say, Puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out NASD, biopharma in total, so this would be our ACG and LSAG businesses together along with some contribution at DGG, grew 20%. And that was really broad-based across all regions. Actually, it was faster than that in China. But if you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Hey, Bob, I'd just add one thing. Although we don't have direct NASD business in China, as Bob highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for LC/MS-based solution for oligo-based R&D research. And the fact that we're in this business ourselves with our own API business and that we have a state-of-the-art facility in our Frederick, Colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our customers doing research in this area as well. So I do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into China, albeit on what we're seen on the research side.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And that small molecule in China was very strong.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Oh, yes, sorry about that. I missed that one. Yes. How can I miss that one?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.
A_182167 2021-02-17 So first question, still trying to think of how to interpret your chemical and energy comments. The comps get pretty easy for that end market. And it doesn't sound like the 2% you reported in the quarter reflects what you're currently seeing on the order side. Are you still expecting kind of flattish chemical and energy performance through the balance of the year? Or could you help me with that?
A_182167 2021-02-17 I think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. And then, Bob, maybe you can answer the...
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. Mike mentioned the headline quite well. As we think about the chemical and energy, we've built in some slight improvement in Q1 and Q2, but have not made any changes to the back half.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And by the way, Dan, I'm not trying to be coy here or cute. We've just seen this market can easily can turn on the dime. And I've had experience where I've called it too soon. So once we feel confident about the book of business we have inside Agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for the year.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Mike, I think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. And as you know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio, both from an instrumentation, but also from an informatics point of view. So when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. It should have been part 2 of my headline. When the business is there, we're going to get it.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Okay. And I appreciate that. And Mike, you've seen a lot of budget cycles. Could you maybe -- what we just saw in the quarter in context, you had a strong quarter, and I know share gain is part of that. All your peers had a really strong quarter. Are we going to look back at this period a couple of years from flush, particularly in pharma? Was this 1 for the history books? Or was this just a good flush? Like how would you characterize that?
A_182167 2021-02-17 I sure hope that's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic, and what we saw was some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the -- our Q2, Q3 because of COVID-19 concerns. And just the fact that customers weren't working, deferred the capital. But again, I would have to say there's more to the story in our Q1 than just that budget flush. So -- and -- but...
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I was going to say, I would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. I don't know -- and -- but I think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in Q4 as well, we started seeing the turnaround. And we saw it continue through Q1, and we're expecting that to continue into the rest of this year as well. So it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon. Certainly, it was stronger than we anticipated. But we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.
A_182167 2021-02-17 So my first question is on share gains. In your prepared remarks, and actually, I think in -- even in the press release, you highlighted market share several times in the context of the strong revenue growth you delivered in the fiscal first quarter. I'm curious if you could opine on where you think you're taking the most share and how sustainable this is? So that's the first topic. The second is on M&A. And the balance sheet is clean. You're re-upping on the share buybacks. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about M&A, and more specifically, the parameters that you are using to evaluate potential acquisitions moving forward?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, Doug, thanks a lot for that. Happy to opine both questions. So yes, we really wanted to make sure the story came through that we had this a great start to 2021, and it wasn't just about a year-end budget flush. There's some really good things that have been going in for several quarters, and this continued in the first quarter. And we very specifically chose the language in key areas. So we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. I would point to liquid chromatography. I’d point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. I'd point to our services business. And -- what else might you add to that? I mean, I think it's pretty much broad-based.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, and in our oligos business.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, oligos because it always comes in 3, the oligos, I mean we had outstanding growth in Q1. So we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers for the entire company. And then relative to the M&A, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter, this past quarter, I should say, being anti-dilutive. But our priority remains, as we communicated, our December Investor and Analyst Day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital expansion building down NASD, for example, but also growth accretive M&A. And that remains our priority. You may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments that the discussions with potential targets, the deal activity is picking up. And I think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our space. But I'd say the volume of discussion has much increased over the last quarter or 2. So nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. And Bob, anything else you want to add?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, the only thing I would say is, Doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our framework really hasn't changed. We're looking at markets that are faster-growing than the markets that we are in or sub-segments of those markets. We think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne that out with ACEA as well as BioTek in the cell analysis space, and it's really helped continue that shift to higher-growth markets, and that's the area that I would think -- and there's really opportunities across all of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream as well. So that's the way I would think about it.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. And Doug, we continue to look for companies also not only to meet that criteria, but also we think there are strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the overall Agilent family, so to speak, and also a business where we think we can make that business even better.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Nice solid quarter, guys. I just wanted to focus on, if you -- when you look at the DGG operating margin in the fourth quarter, it was obviously very strong. Just in terms of sustainability for that, what was driving that? And what should we expect as we go forward in '21?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Hey, Bob, do you and Sam want to tag team on this?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to Sam. I mean you see the strength really was volume-driven here -- and when we look at it. And as we ramp up that NASD facility, that's generated a very nice incremental growth on the bottom-line. As we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really start showing up yet there. But I think that -- and then some of the qPCR activities and related have really helped drive this. Sam?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, Bob, great lead-in. I'll just add as you said, NASD, that business, we are in a place where we are getting -- using more and more our capacity. And that's a good thing as it relates to margin. On the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products, such as our SureSelect NGS target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter, and we anticipate that continuing to grow. That's high margin. We have leadership in NGS quality control. And it's not just instruments there, there's ongoing consumables that go along with standards. So we expect our leadership position for that to grow. And we haven't talked about in a little while. But this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication for PD-L1 to go along with KEYTRUDA for triple-negative breast cancer, and that's another place where we have leadership and drives good margin for us.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Great. And just one quick follow-up. Just more of a high level. As you continue to grow your ACG franchise, could you just talk about how that impacts some of the divisions? And as you expand your reach, does that really help drive the LSG division and other types of segments that you have, just given that it just continues your reach within the market and deeper customer penetration?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, Matt, you're on the right theme here. So in fact, when I talked about this most recently inside Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG businesses come together. And there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help one another, right? So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC, LC/MS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story we've been talking about for a number of years. And when you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers, they truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to Agilent instrument side. Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them. And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the outside world, 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ryskin from Bank of America.
A_182167 2021-02-17 This is Mike on for Derik. I want to follow-up on one thing you touched on it earlier. I mean, we've already hit on LC and just broader pharma markets a little bit. You had a comment of higher growth and pharma expected going forward. I just wanted to go a little deeper and try to get a sense for what are the key drivers here because there's so many moving pieces. You've got the end of your flush and maybe some catch-up in COVID early in the year. NASD obviously doing very well. Selling out is becoming a bigger part of the picture. You've got the share gains. So I'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader, higher levels of spend in pharma? Are we at to start of another LC replacement cycle? If you pay off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going forward for the next couple of years that would give you confidence that that's a little more sustainable? I got a follow-up to that.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then Bob we welcome your commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expected to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Immuno-oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come. So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but what I do think is going to happen is, it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma. And I think it's a market I know we're betting on right now at Agilent.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And then my follow-up on that is, by our math, if you take the magnitude of the 1Q beat and then also the stronger FX tailwind for the rest of the year, that accounts for roughly $175 million of the raised fiscal year guide. And maybe you have these other items coming in. You mentioned the COVID test. You've got the -- all your comments on the strength in the current market. So where exactly is the downside risk? I mean, especially given the comps over the next couple of quarters, what are the areas we should be keeping an eye on that would keep you from doing something closer to 10%-plus quarterly?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, it's a great question. And I think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right? There's still the variance out there. We haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things that we're watching. And we haven't built any of the COVID testing that you just talked about into the numbers. So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the qPCR side that we feel confident about, and that would be on top of these. And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and...
A_182167 2021-02-17 We’re just one quarter in.
A_182167 2021-02-17 But we don't expect the momentum to abate.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from UBS.
A_182167 2021-02-17 I guess first question is maybe on China first, just I don't know if I missed it. Did you give what number or what growth rate you're assuming for the full year? And then within that, could you just discuss a bit more detail on the components of that, in particular, food, obviously, very strong this quarter. But how much more catch up potential is there in food, given how weak that business is then?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. Let me take -- I'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, Mike, on the second one.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, absolutely.
A_182167 2021-02-17 In China, we had forecasted roughly high single-digits at the beginning of the year. It certainly started much stronger than that. So we're expecting it be double-digits for the full year, really driven by both pharma and food. Those would be the two -- the upside drivers to our initial guide. And then I think on food, we've seen -- we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an improvement in Q4. And that improvement continued here into Q1. And we would expect that to continue, given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth. But we're not quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. I think also with food, I'm not sure I would really would use catch up describe this because, clearly, where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work, had deferred investment, I think this has been part of the coming together of the new 5-year plan for China, and that's what's really driving this. So we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. I think it's hard to know, Dan -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long-term, which it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high single-digit longer term. And I think that's probably where we'd land, on your question, although I think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. We -- Mike, to your point, in our initial guide, we assume kind of a mid-single-digit as the recovery, and it's probably high single-digit to double-digit for the range for the full year.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on the NASD? What was the dollar contribution this quarter? What's kind of assumed in the full year? I don't know if you've changed that at all. And I know you've touched upon this, but in terms of other modalities besides interference, I guess, is that still -- it sounds like it's something that could possibly come, but we're still going to wait to hear from you guys on that.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. What I would say, Dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past, $200 million a year. We hit that kind of where we expected to in Q1.
A_182167 2021-02-17 We're really happy with how that business is ramping.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And we're not done yet.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Hey, Bob, I would just add to that, that as I mentioned before, RNAi interference is our primary focus, but we are doing programs on Guide RNA for CRISPR, and we are at full tilt with that. But we are always looking to be in tune with new modalities. And if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely apprised of that as well.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Mike, maybe one for you. Just on the chemical and energy side, certainly appreciate the conservatism baked in here. Can you just talk a little bit -- I know in the past, you've talked about kind of the shift from insourcing to outsourcing from customers and how that should play nicely into your strengths. Can you just talk about, I guess, where we are in that process and how big of an opportunity that is for you guys? .
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I think we're still early days on that. I think it's -- that's part of the discussion. I think the investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech refresh. But I think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and insourcing that we've been talking about. And I think this probably points to us being able to be able to sustain a mid-single-digit kind of end market. So it's -- I mean, it points to the fact that chemical and energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers will not be a drag on the overall growth rate, any material extended off. So I think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth in the C&E market as well, albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening in the overall economy.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Okay. Now it's going to be the year of durability at least. And then maybe just one...
A_182167 2021-02-17 I like what you said, I should have used durability. How was the short to answer your question.
A_182167 2021-02-17 All good. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one on the academic side. Obviously, that's been lingering a little bit on the soft side, not only for you guys, but for much of the industry. I guess, where do you think we are there in terms of whatever metrics you guys look at, whether it's customers in the labs or whatever it may be? Maybe just kind of dive in that a little bit.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. Great question. So when we’re talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right now. We think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think about 60% are working at reduced capacity. We think about 10% are closed. And we really think it's going to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vaccinations out. I think until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, I'd say, Bob, for the -- until we actually see a change in the overall…
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, I think the real catalyst for us, Patrick, to Mike's point, is what's going to happen in the fall semester for classes?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Are people -- are students going to be back full? Or is it still going to be at kind of reduced rates and so forth.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes.
A_182167 2021-02-17 So we're expecting continued recovery, albeit slow, really, and that's what we're looking at in addition to some of the kind of the macro levels.
A_182167 2021-02-17 I would say, though, that the conversation with customers is very robust right now. So it's just a matter of things opening up.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.
A_182167 2021-02-17 I had a follow-up question to Mike Ryskin's question as it relates to guidance, Bob. Maybe trying to ask it a different way. Have you really changed your organic or core growth assumptions over the remainder of the year? Because even in the first quarter here, you back out a couple of hundred basis points from sort of end-of-year budget spending. The first quarter still did basically twice what you were initially expecting for growth in the first quarter. And just looking to your guidance and doing some math, it looks like you really haven't made too much of a change for the organic growth over the remainder of the year. Is that fair to assume?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. I would say we took Q1. We also upgraded Q2 and made some modest changes to the back half of the year, but most of that would be in the areas -- once we get further into the year, that would be an opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. So I think bottom-line, you're in the ballpark.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Okay. And then just a follow-up question on diagnostics. So I guess 2 things to it. One, do you think we return to 2019 or normal levels in your non-COVID Diagnostics business this year? And then also, could you just provide a reminder on where you see your PCR test potentially fitting once it does come to market?
A_182167 2021-02-17 You want to take the first one and Sam the second one?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. The short answer is yes, we expect it to get back, but again, latter half of this year. We're starting to see improvement. If you look at it by region, China is back. Certain pockets in Europe are back and certain places in the U.S. are back as well. But I think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least before it gets back to pre-COVID levels.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. With regards to your second question on qPCR, for COVID-19, our master mixes, our instruments are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world. When our own test comes to market, we see the opportunity. There's still a dearth of robust testing solutions that are available. So we'll have the right performance going after the right fragments or looking at the right elements of COVID-19. And it's really about our broad ability to distribute, make it available and also something that could be automatable on multiple platforms. So we think we'll have a play.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Our final question today comes from the line of Paul Knight from KeyBanc.
A_182167 2021-02-17 So obviously, you've got a full array of products in the analytical instrument marketplace. And it goes back to, I think, Doug's question in terms of M&A, an opportunity. Where do you think you are in the full solution in cell analysis? Is there a lot to build? Is there a lot to buy in that particular market?
A_182167 2021-02-17 We think so. In fact, thanks for the question, Paul. You may recall -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in on this question as well. We teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully really proud of the business we've built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. We're playing in a much larger SAM. And we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well. Jacob, your thoughts there?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes, certainly. We've been very intentional about how we build out our portfolio. Firstly, it’s with instrument platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market. And the next thing that would be the -- logic next step is to look at content, how do we actually get content on our instrument portfolio. So that's clearly an area we're looking into. But I actually think with the footprint, there's also opportunity to add other technique modalities into that. So we are -- we have open eyes. We follow what we call the tale of strains -- strain for all. And -- but -- and we wait to put another firm on that strain. And so we are -- keep our eyes open and then see what happens.
A_182167 2021-02-17 And then the last question would be you had mentioned your cost-cutting program that had started in the second quarter of last year, where you are -- where are you in that process? And what happens to cost-cutting when travel and entertainment might come back kind of post-COVID?
A_182167 2021-02-17 Yes. We're seeing some of that. And some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant drop, and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes. We're not seeing it go back. And our goal is to not have it go back. So we think we're at a new watermark here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. Now we are increasing investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some of the capacity that we talked about before. But certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth, we're not looking for that to go back. It will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been doing business before. Customers don't want it, and we are not going to let it happen.
A_182167 2021-02-17 Absolutely. To Bob's point, as I spoke the other day to our global field team, and we were talking about embracing our new ways of working. And of course, a lot of people drove and love to be back on the road. But not everybody feels that way. And the customers certainly don't feel that way because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms, there is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on the customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul, really challenged ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working. And this allows us to put money into areas that really do matter to customers. So I'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment.
A_182167 2021-02-17 That concludes Q&A, and it also concludes today's Agilent Technologies First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you, everybody, for joining. You may now disconnect.

We look forward to having you join us on December 9. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thanks, Ankur, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. Today, I want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story. The Agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020. We posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter. Revenues are up 8% on a reported basis, and up 6% core. Operating margins are a healthy 24.9%. EPS of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year. These numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that's built for continued growth. Our better than expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end markets. Geographically, China continues to lead the way with double-digit growth. From an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits. In addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations. We also saw a rebound in U.S. sales during the quarter. Overall, COVID-19 tailwinds contributed just over two points of core growth. Achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years. I couldn't be more pleased with the way the Agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020. We have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way. During the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high single-digits on a reported basis. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis, and up 4% core. LSAG growth is broad-based. The cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates. In terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits, and pharma high single-digits. LSAG remains extremely well-positioned and is outperforming the market. The Agilent CrossLab Group came in with revenues at $518 million. This is up a reported 9% and up 7% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activities in our CrossLabs continues to increase. The ACG team continues to build on it's already [deep] [ph] connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic, and continue to drive improved efficiencies and lab operations. In the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported, and up 7% core. Growth was broad-based, with NASD oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%. The Genomics and pathology businesses continue to improve during the quarter. I'm also very proud of our NASD team for successfully ramping production at our new Frederick site this year. We have built a very strong position in this attractive market, with excellent long-term prospects for high growth. Let's not shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results. Despite the disruption, uncertainty, and economic turmoil dealing with a global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered solid results. We generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis, and up nearly 1% core. To put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth. In Q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first important of COVID-19 in our business in China. Both Q2 and Q3 declined low single-digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted broad shutdowns. With 6% core growth, 8% reported in Q4, we're seeing business and economies start to recover. As a result, we are clearly exiting 2020 with solid momentum. Our recurring types of businesses, represented by ACG and DGG prove resilient, growing low to mid single-digits for the year. In a very tough CapEx market, our LSAG instrument business declined only 2% for the year, and returned a growth in the final quarter. China led the way for our recovery with accelerating growth as the year progressed. In our end markets, pharma remained the most resilient, and food markets recovered most quickly. Full-year earnings per share grew 5% during fiscal 2020, to $3.28. The full-year operating margin of 23.5% is up 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. As we head into 2021 we do so with tremendous advantage. Our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy, with the focus of high growth markets continues to deliver. Our ability to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions is also serving us well. The way our sales and service teams have been able to quickly pivot to meet customer requirements during the pandemic has been nothing short of remarkable. You know, last year this time, I used this call to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model. Our approach is focused on delivering above market growth, while expanding operating margin, along with a balanced deployment of capital. We prioritized the plan of our capital both internally and externally on additional growth. A few proof points on our growth-oriented capital deployment strategy. A year ago, we spoke about recently closing the BioTek acquisition and the promise of growth that BioTek represented. Today, BioTek is no longer a promise, but a driver of growth. In total, the cell analysis business generated more than $300 million in revenue for us during the year, with double-digit growth in Q4, and continued strong growth prospects. Similar to last year, I was talking about ramping up our new Frederick site facility, a $185 million capital investment. In addition to successfully ramping Frederick as we planned, we did so with an expanding book of business. We also recently announced additional $150 million investment to add future manufacturing capacity. We are aggressively adding capacity to capture future growth opportunities in this high-growth market. Even in the face of a pandemic, we stayed true to our build and buy strategy. We have clearly seen the advantages of our approach. I'm confident our strategy will continue to produce strong results for us. The strength of our team and resilience of our business model has served us well, and as you can see from the numbers, our growth strategy is producing outstanding results for our customers, employees, and shareholders. While uncertainty remains as we being fiscal 2021, we're operating from a position of strength. Because of this, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, and working as a one Agilent team on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As I noted earlier, I couldn't be more pleased with the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob, you're up.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I my remarks today, I'll provide some additional revenue detail, and take you through the fourth quarter income statement, and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021, and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we saw strong growth exceeding our expectations, especially considering the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19. For the quarter, revenue was $1.48 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 5.6%. Reported growth was stronger, at 8.5%, currency contributed 1.7%, while M&A added 1.2 points of growth. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, showed strength across all regions, and delivered 12% growth in the quarter. Both small and large molecule businesses grew, with large molecule posting strong double-digit growth. We continue to invest and build capabilities in faster growth biopharma markets, and offer leading solutions across both small and large molecule applications. The food market also experienced double-digit growth during the quarter, positing a 16% increase in revenue. While our growth in food business was broad-based, China led the way. And as Mike noted earlier, our chemical and energy market exceeded our expectations growing 3% after two quarters of double-digit declines. Well, one quarter does not a trend make, we are certainly pleased with this result, and the growth came primarily from the chemical and materials segment. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 1% during Q4 led by recovery in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to see recovery in non-COVID '19 testing as expected, although the levels that are still slightly below pre-COVID levels. Academia and government was flat to last year, continuing the steady improvement in this market, and revenue in the environmental and forensics market declined mid single-digits against a strong comparison to last year. On a geographic basis, all regions returned to growth. China continues to lead our results with broad based growth across most end markets. For the quarter, China finished with 13% growth, and ended the full-year up 7% just a great result from our team in China. The Americas delivered a strong performance during the quarter, growing 5% with results driven by large pharma food and chemical and energy, and in Europe, we grew 2% as we saw lab activity improved sequentially benefiting from our on-demand service business in ACG, as well as from a rebound in pathology and genomics as elective procedures and screening started to resume. However, while improving CapEx demand still lags are servicing consumables business. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55%. This was down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily by a shift in revenue mix and an unfavorable impact of FX on margin. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 24.9%. This is down 20 basis points from Q4 of last year. As we made some incremental growth focused investments in marketing and R&D, which we expect to benefit us in the coming year. The quarter also capped off with full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year. Our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%. In addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong. In Q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, but more than $60 million over last year, and in Q4, we continued our balanced capital approach to repurchasing $2.48 million shares for $250 million. For the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million, and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt; all-in-all, a very good end to the year. Now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year. We and our customers have been dealing with COVID-19 for nearly a full-year and are seeing our end markets recover. Visibility into the business cadence is improving, and as a result, we're initiating guidance for 2021. There is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically. It is with this perspective that we're taking a positive, but prudent view of Q1 in the coming year. For the full-year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% in core growth of 4% to 6%. This range takes into account the steady macro environment we're seeing. It does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shutdowns like we saw in the first half of this year. In addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow led by DGG. We expect DDG to grow high single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics. We believe ACG will return to its historical high single-digit growth, while LSAG is expected to grow low to mid single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorbed the build-out costs of the second line and our Frederick Colorado NASD site, and then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies, and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks. All this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $3.57, and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our NASD expansion. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let's finish with our first quarter guidance, but before we get into the specifics, some additional context. Many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in COVID-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty, and while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during Q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for Q1 because of the current situation with the pandemic. For Q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing recorded growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and first quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share. Before opening the call for questions, I want to conclude by echoing Mike's comments about the amazing work the Agilent team performed during fiscal 2020. To be where we are now, after knowing where we stood in March, is truly remarkable. Add to this the strong momentum we saw in Q4, I truly believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for Q&A.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thanks, Bob. David, let's provide the instructions for Q&A.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey, guys, congrats on the blueprints here, and a couple of questions for me.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey, Vijay.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Mike, maybe first on the guidance part here, I guess with a Q1 guidance of 4.5% to 5.5% core, does it have -- does it assume any core tailwinds because, I guess you look at Q4, I mean 6% core, any reason why the core should slow down sequentially?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, let me start with, Bob. So again, thanks for the earlier comments, Vijay. So how to characterize our Q1 guide is positive, but we're using a very prudent approach, and that we got a lot of confidence in that in terms of we're reinstating the guidance, and we had very good momentum in Q4, and we looked at the backlog, we feel very confident about reinstating guidance, but the virus is still out there, and we still think there's still a higher level of uncertainty that calls for a prudent approach, so hence the positive but prudent approach. If it turns out better we'd be -- we'd love to be in a position of being able to raise our outlook for the year, but we thought for the first guide for the year, including Q1, and should take a positive and prudent approach, this is recognizing that the virus is still out there. Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add anything to that.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Vijay, I think a couple of things, you know, the thing that I would say is we didn't end the year with emptying the tank out, and feel really good about that, but that being said, we do have some business that is somewhat susceptible to some of these areas, and so we probably have greater visibility or variability in some of our diagnostics businesses. So, as Mike said, we're taking kind of prudent approach there, and the other areas is we want to see more than just one quarter in the chemical and energy business. I think that's one of the areas where I think -- we think we're biased to the upside and the way we're kind of thinking about the business, but it's certainly with a recovery. We do expect some COVID tailwinds, to your point. It's probably on the order of roughly about one-and-a-half to two points, kind of consistent with what we've seen in the last -- the last several quarters. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.
A_180114 2020-11-24 That's helpful, Bob; and Mike, one bigger picture question for you. I think you mentioned NASD was up 40% in the quarter. Did that business accelerate NASD, and I'm curious, the longer-term opportunity here when you think about it, how -- can this end up being a $500 million product for Agilent as you look at four or five years out? I'm curious to know your thoughts, and Bob, I think you mentioned the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion inclusive of investments in Frederick facility. What do you think the impact was of those investments on the margins, or I guess what I'm asking is what should margin expansion have been without those investments? Thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey, Bob -- thanks for the questions, Vijay. How about I take the first part, and then you can take the second part. So that's not out of the realm of reason, your first question in terms of the longer-term potential total revenue for Agilent. We kind of put a teaser out there earlier about our December analyst and investor day, so we'll talk a bit more about NASD when we meet, but as you know, we are really pleased with -- and we've talked about in the past in terms of getting to that exit rate of over $200 million business, and while our capacity in terms of the physical capacity is built, we're now just finishing up the first year of operations, so we're -- just like we did with our [indiscernible] continue to find ways to drive more productivity and efficiency out of that asset, and we just announced another expansion of another production line within that existing facility. So I hope what you're hearing is a very bullish tone, both in terms of the market growth but also our ability to get our -- more of our unfair share, if you will, to the capital share in a growing market.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to build on that, what Mike talked about, the beauty of that business is it continues to accelerate throughout the year, and that 40% -- that roughly 40% in Q4 was the highest it was all year, and that team has don't just a fantastic job of scaling that business, and we're not done, and as Mike said, we're making incremental investments in building out that capacity, which we'll continue to make throughout the course of next year. That is probably about a 20 basis point headwind next year and in the operating margin just rough numbers there, Vijay, but extremely pleased with the work that that team has been able to do, and continuing to drive that growth, and so we feel very good about that business.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thank you, guys.
A_180114 2020-11-24 You're welcome.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, hi, Bob and Mike. Thanks for taking the question. So, Bob, actually on one of the question on guidance, and this is probably a favorite topic for you, the Chinese Lunar New Year.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Oh yes. That's the New Year again, isn't it?
A_180114 2020-11-24 That time of the year. So, this time, obviously, you are seeing how the troops are acting on the ground, how things are there, and I would suspect it would be a lesser impact this year, lesser travel, but correct me if I'm wrong on that, and then in light of that, I mean the guidance again appears conservative. Is there anything that we ought to keep in mind for a market that is growing double-digit for you already, and is a sizable portion of your revenue? So just walk us through how are you thinking about the Lunar New Year impact here.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, that's a great question, Puneet, and as you accurately state, our expectation is the impact is going to be much less this year than it was last year for all the things that you just talked about, less travel, timing of when it is, and so forth, relative to Q1, and what we're seeing is actually very strong continued recovery and performance in our China business, and I would say that there's -- Q1 is no different, and so, the story there certainly remains in tact, and I would expect it to be very strong performance in Q1. I think what we're trying to do is there's nothing in particular, but I think we're just probably taking a little more prudent approach in Europe, and as we're seeing some of the shutdowns, particularly in some of these areas. And I think as we look at where are the things that could potentially be upsides or downsides, I think that continued recovery in chemical and energy across the business, also continued performance in Americas. We're expecting kind of an average budget flush, so to speak. That's another question that's probably -- if people are thinking about by -- for the end of the year and both of those things could be better than expected.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Bob, if you could just jump into that, just amplify the point, Puneet, that Bob made. We're very, very happy with our China business, and we exited the year with momentum, and that's carrying forward into 2021. We're positioning ourselves with a wait-and-see moment on C&E, and that could be a source of upside for the year, and [like I said earlier] [ph], we're fully prepared to reflect that in a revised outlook, and I would just use the word, maybe, prudent as a way to describe as the adjective Bob and I have been using to describe our guide.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, that's -- no, that's very helpful, thanks, and if I could get a sense on the -- in the cell analysis business, that business continues to be really strong for you, BioTek, as you host other products in that product line, just wanted to get a sense of what are some of the key drivers there, is it largely the cell and gene therapy, the cellular product and drug product market, or is there something in the academic end that is driving that growth or specifically in China? Would appreciate and helping frame what's exactly happening there, and the opportunity there longer-term.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question, and as I mentioned in my call script, we're really pleased with how we've been able to integrate the BioTek team, make them part of the Agilent family, and then how that collective has lead to having us have a very healthy cell analysis, just north of $300 million, growing nicely for us, and I know that Jacob would love to be able to have an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the cell analysis, back to Jacob, your thoughts on the specific questions that Puneet put forward?
A_180114 2020-11-24 First of all, let me just echo that I think it's very impressive what Agilent has been doing here the past year, and the growth actually stems from many multiple dimensions here. First of all, we have seen, so first of all, with the testing that a lot of our BioTek portfolio has been using for that for the ELISA testing, and -- but we also see, generally speaking, imaging being very relevant in the academic markets, but also in the biopharma markets, and the [CS] [ph] portfolio with the flow of tachometry is also seeing quite a lot of interest. So it's really broad across both academic and biopharma and COVID-related that we see interest. Lifestyle analysis was where we felt a few years ago that this was an area that would continue to see in our growth. Particularly that point about immune-oncology, we're pleased that has moved into a broader understanding on the immune system, right now on COVID, but generally speaking I think would be a focus for many years to come. So very pleased, and we continue to expect good growth in that business.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, and hey, Puneet, just one thing because you mentioned China, and we see really China as a huge opportunity for us going forward. The real growth has been primarily in the U.S. and Europe. I mean it's growing in China as well, but it's off a very small base. So when we think about the opportunities going forward, leveraging the large infrastructure that Agilent has is really a big opportunity for us for many, many years to come in the cell analysis space.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Great. Okay, thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey, good afternoon. Mike, I wondering if you could talk a little more on the biopharma strength, 12% on a 7% comp is obviously phenomenal. I know you had 2% from NASD, and you just talked about cell analysis, but can you maybe just talk more broadly on the strength in biopharma. Was any of this a catch-up from slower setting in the first-half of the year? And how do you think about the sustainability of demand. I know you mentioned you're thinking about an average budget flush, but can you just talk to the broader strength in biopharma?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, sure, happy to do so, Tycho, and without giving away too many of the tidbits that I want to talk about more -- in more depth in a few weeks. There was no catch-up here. This is part of this continued strength in the biopharma area. It's an area of focus, and we'll go into some more detail with you in a few weeks, but it's an area of focus in terms of increased investments relative to our biopharma tools, but the instrumentation along with chemistry platform, a real workflow focus there across the whole value chain, but we're getting growth, as you mentioned earlier, NASD, but that's -- the story is much bigger, and bigger, and that's to be honest with you. And then, obviously, we're picking up some growth here in the cell analysis. So I think it's really a multifaceted strategy that really driving this growth. We think it's sustainable. We think a double-digit outlook on the biopharma portion of Agilent's business is quite reasonable. We're really excited, and it's an investment priority for us.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, and Tycho, maybe if I can add to Mike's point, in terms of -- because it's not only the platforms in the portfolio that we have on the instrument basis, which we've been making some heavy investments in, but it's also been the informatics and the software piece, which is has allowed us to be able to kind of plug in to the labs, the analytical labs, and then you bring in the ACG services portfolio that helped them manage the labs, and particularly with everything that's going on right now, the last thing they want is their scientists to be managing the instrumentation. They want them to be doing the science, and so, we think we've got a very compelling software and tools offering, and I think it's showing up in the marketplace across multiple technology platforms really.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Great, and then Mike, you used the phrase, wait and see mode for C&E a couple minutes ago, and it's good to see that back to growth, can you maybe just talk on some of the data points you're watching in your customer base and how you're thinking about the recovery curve there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, thanks Tycho. So, my comments come back from my first year as a CEO when I tried to call the trend of the C&E business, and eventually it turned out I think it was all by several quarters. So I learned my lesson, so to speak. So as Bob mentioned, one quarter trend does not make but we're very encouraged by that, because it's the first time we've seen some growth after those two double-digit declines earlier this year. And we look at a couple of things, Tycho one is the PMIs and the positive moves in the PMIs are indicative of improved end market strength, particularly in C&E, we also look at what we estimate to be the age of the installed base, because a lot of aged equipment out there, and that's been probably at very high levels, and then we look at the deal flow. So, kind of all those factors, the macro outlook from PMIs what we know to be the current environment for customers in terms of the age of their installed base, and then also overseen in our funnels, and you know, Agilent has a real strength in this market. So I think we will benefit from returned to growth, again we're not ready yet to put it into numbers for Q1 in the full-year, but we're hopeful that that trend will continue. There're some indications that it could, but let's give it another quarter or so.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, and then lastly before I hop off, one quick one on China, one of your coolest companies, Mettler, talked about pent-up demand kind of suggested that what they saw may not be sustainable. Have you seen anything in your order book that would suggest what you're seeing in China?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, no, Tycho really appreciate you asking that question because not at all, I mean, this has been a continuing steady flow of business. We think the end markets are really strong here. We see a lot of strength in China Government funding to make sure they stimulate the economy, and then we talked earlier about just overall their investments in improving the quality of life, you noticed the strong growth in the food market, continued strength in pharma. So no, we've seen this. Now, I think we really look closely at the pacing and it's all nothing unusual.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Tycho, I think we've been extraordinarily pleased with the way our China businesses performed throughout the course of this year, and when you think about kind of our cadence through Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, we've seen accelerated growth. So we saw our lowest growth in the first quarter where we saw the impact of COVID-19, but then what we've seen is improvements as opposed to this real huge increase, and then kind of a drop-off. So, we're not expecting any drop-off, and we haven't seen that in our order book or any of the conversations that we've had with our customers that there was sort of a material catch-up.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 You're quite welcome, Tycho.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, thanks. Good afternoon; Mike, a couple of questions on LSAG.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Sure.
A_180114 2020-11-24 I'm curious, if you could speak to the order book in the fourth quarter, and to the extent that you may have built some backlog there, and curious to speak to perhaps the margin compression in the fourth quarter, but that was mostly mix or is today's dynamics there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Happy to see you, Brandon. So, one of the reasons why we were able to reinstate guidance this year was what we saw in the LSAG order book, and as you know, we stopped a few years ago talking about specifics around orders, but I think in today's call, it's really prudent for us to give you a sense of why Bob and I have this confidence around the outlook. So we didn't guessed as we ran across the finish line for 2020, order book was strong in LSAG and as continued into the fairly few weeks of this year. So again, all the other caveats aside being prudent and recognition of the virus, we feel pretty good about our ability to reinstate guideline because as we mentioned earlier reinstate guidance as mentioned earlier, LSAG was one where we hit the most early on the year, and I think we're feeling pretty good about that. And Bob, as I recall, most of the gross margin is really just a mix of the various instrument platforms.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, that's right. I mean, I think Brandon, to read what Mike is saying, I mean we feel very good, orders exceeded revenue and exceeded our expectations, and so, it was a bit of a mix shift that is impacting that, but we would expect that to kind of normalize out throughout the course of next year, and so, we feel very good about kind of where that business is going into 2021.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Brandon, just one additional thought here which is, we've seen a real change in the price environment. So, that's why we can say pretty common that has happened to be the mix product this quarter.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Super, and one more for Bob, you mentioned currency with the drag to margins in the fourth quarter, could you quantify that, the magnitude of the operating line, and then what you penciled in for impact of FX to operating margins in '21?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, it was roughly about 40-ish, 45-ish on the COGS line, and some of that was offset through the bottom line, and for next year less impactful, much less impactful than that, probably less than about 10 points, 10 basis points.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Super, thanks.
A_180114 2020-11-24 You're welcome.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thank you. So, to start off, on the guidance, a question for probably you Bob, you've touched on this in pieces, but can you give us at a high level what your key assumptions are, by region and by end-markets?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, so by at the highest level, we're expecting steady improvement throughout the course of the year from the standpoint of the economic perspective, if I think about it from a geography first, China's going to lead the way with high single-digit growth continuing the momentum that we've seen, we ended this year FY '20 about 7%, and we're expecting that or better into next year, and then what you would see as a recovery in the Americas getting back to kind of mid to high single-digits, and then followed by Europe, which would be kind of the low to mid single-digits. So that's kind of on an end market perspective, how we would think about it, it's predicated on that continued recovery, and that we would as I mentioned before, not have any extended periods of shutdown that would disrupt business. I think the good thing is what we're seeing not only ourselves, but our customers are being able to operate in a different environment than they had the first time these were shut down. So we're not expecting any material impact there, and from an end-market perspective, the strength is really going to be the continued strength that we've seen in the last several years really driven behind our pharma business, which is probably high single-digits with biopharma as one of the earlier questions came out, probably growing double-digits going forward. And then food, we'll probably expect maybe a little tempering, where it'd be great to have 16% every quarter, but we're not ready to put that into our plan, but I would expect continued recovery there probably in the mid-single-digits and also recovery in our diagnostics and clinical business, particularly in that same kind of mid-single-digits, and probably ramping throughout the course of the year, probably more muted on the academia, and government probably flattish to low, and as we talked about before chemical and energy flattish, but that's really one where we're hoping that we're biased, and there's more upside than downside here, but certainly given the momentum, but one quarter is too early to put a forecast on there, and so, we're assuming roughly flat and then probably recovery in the environmental and forensics market low-single-digits.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, thanks for that overview, and that's my follow-up, you touched on there being a wider range of outcomes in '21 and typical and mentioned at the bottom end doesn't capture any threats around reestablishment of lockdowns or whatnot. Do you feel the high-end of guidance really captures all the benefits from easy comparisons, any potential upside there might be or how would you frame, what you're capturing in the high-end there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, I'd say it's continued momentum, but I think that there's probably more upsides and downsides in the way that we're trying to capture that certainly exiting at a 6% growth rate, there are we're probably the biggest areas are around chemical and energy and the pace of recovery in academia and government, and if those continue, I would say - let me put it this way, if chemical and energy continued at 3% and growing, we'll be that number.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, absolutely. Thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thanks, Dan.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, good afternoon guys.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Good evening, Doug.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Maybe I have a few cleanup guidance questions, but before I get to that one, I just wanted to talk about your performance specific to your mass spec product line. You talked about another quarter of double-digit growth. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to unpack that a bit more and just talk about what's driving this, and specifically is China and more specifically China food, a major driver, I guess I'm just trying to get at which segments of the portfolio or specific end markets or geographies that really stand out within a pretty robust and impressive growth rate there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, Doug really appreciate the opportunity to have Jacob comment more deeply on that, but as you know, I highlighted that in my script, we were able to call out that double-digit growth. We're extremely proud of that. And Jacob, I think you've got some additional insights that you could share with Doug.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, that's a great question, and I'm certainly proud of what the team has been doing over the past years, because this is not only a quarterly effect here, but we have done a quiet and overhaul of our master portfolio, particularly the LC/MS portfolio over the last few years, both on the high-end triple quad, but also the single quad, and [indiscernible] the team applications, and this is really what the customer is looking for right now. So, you can really see that the investments we have done really resonates with our customer base, and right now, I would say in most geographies and in most end markets, but if you look into it's biopharma and China is definitely a big part of this story, but -- and the other element into it is that we pivoted very quickly to remote customer engagement during this beginning of this year, and when the customer has to shut down the laboratories, we were there for them. We did support them when the tough times, and you can see that pay dividends today that they also continue with the partnership with accidents. So, I actually believe that we are in a quite good momentum here with the mass aide business.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, all right.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, that sure does. Thank you for that, and then maybe just a few guidance questions, yes, so this'll be kind of a speed round in a way, because you have got some questions about these already, but on China, did you expect double-digit growth in fiscal '21? On gross margin, you talked about some of the headwinds you saw in Q4 becoming less pronounced moving forward. So, do you expect gross margin overall to get back up to the 56 plus level? And then on COVID-19, I think you talked about just over two points of COVID tailwinds in the quarter. I'm just wondering if looking forward either fiscal Q1 or for the full-year, if you could see a scenario where this would accelerate over time if serology volumes began to inflect in a positive way and same thing on the antibody business, could those in combination drive more of a tailwind moving forward, so China gross margin and COVID-19?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, so China, high single-digits, maybe low double-digits based on the range that we gave you in terms of COVID what I would say is, we are expecting less incremental the growth, but certainly the things that you talked about are baked into our guidance. So more serology our antigen based testing or even vaccine driven volume is not fully baked into the numbers that we are -- it's just too early to tell, but those are certainly be things that are potential upsides, and then the last one, I know which was your second question around gross margin, I would expect it to stabilize and not see this the same level of decline. Now, what I would say is you will have some mix shifts, right, because our ACG business, which is lower gross margin than the instrument business, but much higher operating margin helps us with that. So, you do see a dampening effect on the gross margin side, but you will more than make up for it on the operating margin side.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, Bob. Sorry.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Doug specific to COVID-19 we'll hit a little bit more of that when we have our Analyst Day, but we are planning to launch in early 2021 our serology test, and there are some things that we're working on that aren't baked into the guide. We'll see how that they play out.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, that's great. Thank you guys for all the time and happy Thanksgiving everybody.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Same to you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, good afternoon.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, Derik.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, Derik.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, so I'm going to do this similar to Doug. I've got a couple of focus questions. I got one guidance cleanup. So I guess specifically, Bob, you mentioned some software pushes in business between the pharma business. Can you be a little bit more specific on that? I mean, is OpenLab taking share against Empower, you winning have be replaced Empower and some of the accounts there, I'm just sort of curious on what the dynamics are in the CDS market?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes. What I would say Doug, excuse me, Derik, is that we feel very good about our competitive positioning with OpenLab and the rest of our products.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay. Now I'll live with that I guess. Yes, and by the way, I'm better looking than Doug. On the Core Genomics business, I mean, we don't really have talk about that. I mean, you talk about the NASD and some other things here, but what is going on in your Core Genomics business, you've got SureSelect, I mean, you've had some pressures and some of that end market there. What is that underlying business growing?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, actually a great question because we didn't highlight that, but actually when you look at sequential performance, that was one of the things that was very, very positive in the DDG business. It recovered very nicely into Q4, and maybe I'll let Sam talk about some of the details there.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. As you said, as we went into the heavy part of the pandemic, if you will, late Q2, Q3, some of the Genomics business also serves clinical diagnostic customers be it for SureSelect being the backbone and some of the leading cancer diagnostic and US-based tests as well as other inherited diseases. So we definitely saw the effect of that, but coming into Q4, we've seen a steady stream of increase there, and we've also seen a positive effect in parts of our portfolio that are related to qPCR be it instruments, be it our consumables that are used and also we have the leading Genomics QC portfolio as you're probably aware of, and we see a number of those products, including our fragment analyzer being used increasingly for picking up conventional or sorry, would the pickup of conventional clinical testing, but also being used for example for some siRNA vaccines that are in development. So, all-in-all, the trend is looking encouraging for our Core Genomics business.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Great, and then just one housekeeping question. For '21, the other income expense line, how should we think about that for '21? Bob do you want to handle that or you want to take that?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, that'd be slightly better than where it is this year.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thank you.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hello, Jack.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thanks. Hi, good afternoon. Let me go back to biopharm, Mike, I was curious if you're seeing any change in terms of customer spending patterns at all, because of COVID-19, there is just been such a focus on bioprocessing, the support vaccines and therapeutics. What's that doing in small molecule if you can call out any trends?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Jack, great question. So, to our delight, it really hasn't seen them cause any kind of material shift. I mean, we're seeing -- in fact, I think Bob in his script, where we saw strength across small molecule and bio -- large molecule. Now the small molecule is not growing as fast as large molecules, it was growing, and…
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, Jack to give you some numbers, I mean for Q4 small molecule grew high single-digits, and for the year it grew low single-digits. So despite all the hoopla, small molecule is not dead.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes. Great, and maybe just to build on that, so the high teens ACG growth in China, could you just parse out for us? How did food do versus how did maybe generics do in terms of some of that consolidation there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Bob, as I recall, and I'd like Padraig on this, I think it was broad-based across all end-markets. Everything was in that double-digit range, and Padraig anything you could add to that?
A_180114 2020-11-24 No, I think you said it well, Mike, I think across both sides of the business, both the chemistries serves as very strong demand in all markets, and we see certainly a strong demand for our installation familiarization and startup services. So I'm really strong across the board in China.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Great, thank you, guys.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow-up on the --
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, Patrick.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hey, Mike, just on the chemical and energy side, it certainly sounds like that's the biggest area of upside, maybe the biggest variable for next year. Sounds like chemicals and material things are improving, can you just give a bit more detail around the customer tone there, and then is energy the bigger variable for '21 maybe just talk through kind of the scenario analysis as you guys think about it certainly seems like there's upside, but maybe just kind of what parts of the business you feel like are the biggest variable there?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, I think that sort of all the kind of this always helpful reminder, but in a kind of our mix, so it's 70:30, 70:30 in chemicals and materials, and 30% energy. Actually the upside on the chemical and material, energy lags, and we aren't really seeing a lot of indications of why that would, that would pick up, but you have to remember some of the chemical companies are actually providing products and such into end markets that support COVID-19. They're feeling, what drives this marketplace? Yes, we talked about PMIs, but really all the PMIs are really related to the view of global growth, and I think that customer base is feeling more confident about where the economy is going and things this shut really slowed down earlier this year just for a must kind of purchases, but I think it's a prove view of the overall economic outlook for the chemical and materials side plus the fact that they have some kind of COVID-19 tailwind to help out. I wouldn't say that's the entire story is just the element of it. I think the biggest part here is just the fact that there's much more common in the customer base about the growth environment from an economic standpoint, Bob anything you would add to that?
A_180114 2020-11-24 Thank you, Mike. I don't.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, yes, that's very helpful, and then maybe just on a capital deployment side. You guys always take the balanced approach, and I'm sure we'll hear more about it in a couple of weeks, but how are things trending in the pipeline on the M&A side, your cash flow has actually been pretty strong? How active should we expect you guys to be on that front? Any changes and thoughts around the size of deals you want to pursue, and any metrics you can throw out there would be helpful? Thanks.
A_180114 2020-11-24 No, no we continue to be very interested in deploying capital for growth standpoint along all the dimensions we talked about earlier. We said that the BioTek size deal, which we were really quite happy with that, that was largest deal we've done to-date. That doesn't mean that would be the largest deal we would do. We've always said, I think it was not magnitudes of delta, and although we didn't closed any deals this year, I think that really was somewhat tied into some of the COVID-19 challenges of doing due diligence and working with potential targets, but we still see this as a key part of our, what we call, our build and buy growth strategy, and think that M&A can be a nice attitude to our core growth businesses. So you guessed right, so we'll talk more about it in a few weeks. We still have aspirations in the space, but really sticking to the model, the framework that we've been using before, which is M&A in markets at a higher growth investor company that aligns strategically with us where they can benefit by our scale and are accretive to the P&L.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, I would say Patrick, just to build on what Mike was saying. I mean, we feel very good about the acquisitions that we made, the last two which was BioTek and ACEA were probably the fastest growing parts of our business, if you take out NASD, and so, I think it validates the space that we're looking at, and we don't see a reason to need to change our M&A framework.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, thanks guys.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Your final question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. I'll just ask one maybe I guess it's a two-parter; one part for Mike, one part for Bob, and…
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay, I'll be giving easy one.
A_180114 2020-11-24 I think you're going to like it. I think you are going to like it.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Okay.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Mike, so last call, you raised this concept, you called it a flight to quality, and you talked about how the team with the execution has been able to drive share gains, I wonder if you could talk about whether you think that as the pandemic subsided in some ways and labs are opening up again, if you think that dynamic has become any more or less acute, and if you think it's sticky, I'm going to go ahead and ask the second part of my -- I guess I'll call it COVID discovery question for Bob; Bob, like a lot of CFOs, you've had a chance to see how much you can save within operating expenses, as we're all working remotely and being more digital. Have you thought about putting any numbers around how much of the savings that you've discovered here could end up being permanent? Thanks a bunch, everybody.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, thanks, Steve. So, in regards to the first one, we probably talked about the flight to quality when money is tight, but we also think tied it to stability, and how we protected our overall field team and our ability to support our customers during the pandemic. So, I think those two things are going to carry us forward. So we think that the stickiness will remain there, and I don't think that the quality will fall out of fashion, and I think as you continue to grow your position in the installed base, it just gives you an upper hand in terms of next buy when they get around to making the next capital purchasing decision.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Yes, I would agree with that, Mike, and I think that, you know, I think two things; one is, we were there when the customers needed us the most, and our team particularly in the field, helping support critical operations and so forth, and that flight to quality on the instrumentation side only pays dividends going forward. So, I think there is no -- there will be no follow-up there, I truly believe that. On the cost side, we're still working through some of those things, a big thing, probably the biggest variable here, and it's got a couple of different tentacles to it would be around travel, and I think we had talked about before at one point in time we're spending roughly $10 million a month in travel, and that that is down, I would say substantially, and our goal is that will be back to $10 million a month, and so, that doesn't say that we're going to necessarily drop it all to the bottom line, but reinvest in some areas that will drive growth going forward, but certainly those, and then there will be more efficient ways of doing things like marketing outreach to our customers, and even operating, one of the things is we still operated and launched new products, despite not having been in the labs for the most part for nine months out of the year, and so, our teams are finding innovative ways to continue to actually move things around without having to spend incremental dollars, so more to come on that.
A_180114 2020-11-24 We think [some things] [ph] are going to stick. Particularly, as it relates to your digital engagement with customers, because there's a huge element of being responsive, and we think that digital cable is a big part of that story, and yes, it has been accelerated by COVID, but we don't think there's any going back either.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Got it. Thank you for all the color, guys.
A_180114 2020-11-24 You're quite welcome.
A_180114 2020-11-24 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. The Agilent team delivered excellent results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. Against this backdrop, Agilent's performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business. Agilent's Q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. Our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis, despite COVID-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. On a core basis, revenues are down 3%. These results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business over the past several years. EPS is $0.78 per share. This is a 3% year-over-year increase. Operating margin grew 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. Our Q3 results are further evidence of the success of our profitable build and by growth strategy. We continue to build a more resilient growth oriented business. Last quarter, I talked to you about the four key priorities we're focused on during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protecting our people; being open for business for our customers; taking decisive action to deliver our P&L and balance sheet; and unwavering commitment to growth. Staying focused on these priorities has helped us navigate through the COVID-19 effects on our team, customers and business. Our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and enhanced digital capabilities. In fact, Q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs. In all regions, we're seeing improvement in lab access for our customers and increase non-COVID-19 testing volumes. There are however regional and end-market differences in the pacing of improvement. Labs access improved through the quarter, although still not at pre-COVID-19 levels. Globally, lab access remains limited in academia, non-COVID-19 research and testing labs. We're also seeing continued limited access at some private sector research labs in Europe and United States. Similarly, non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing volumes improved throughout the quarter, but remained down from prior levels. Hospital access in Europe and the U.S. is improving, although disrupted at times by virus spread. While there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe, caution remains at customer capital expenditure decisions. Consistent with our thinking coming into the quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. As expected, China led the way for us and exceeded our expectations with revenues up 11%. China's growth in the quarter is broad-based across all end market and for all business groups. While improving the rate of recovery in Europe, and the Americas lags China, given the timing when these reasons first felt the brunt of the pandemic, European revenues are down 5%. Americas market conditions trailed both China and Europe with revenues declining 10%. However, as we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic testing volumes. On a total Company basis, we exited July with modest growth across all major markets. Now, let's talk about our performance by business groups. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. Our team is focused and determined to gain market share despite a constrained capital environment. The strength of our portfolio coupled with an energized and stable sales team is paying dividends. I'm also very proud of contributions are selling our cell analysis technologies are making in COVID-19 virus research. Our M&A strategy is working and making a difference in the pandemic fight. Our CrossLab Group revenues grew 1%. Increase in customer activity led to increased sales of consumables and an uptake of on-demand services. The CrossLab team continues to win large, multiyear contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. We will continue to increase our competitiveness in this space. Our Diagnostics and Genomics Group revenues declined 8%. While our overall pathology and genomics businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and non-COVID-19 lab openings. Partially offsetting this, our nucleic acid solution business delivered another strong quarter, growing almost 25%. We are very excited about the future of our NASD business. As we announced earlier today, we plan to more than double oligo manufacturing capacity and our new Frederick, Colorado site. This expansion helps us meet significantly increasing customer demand. We are growing double-digit and expect to continue this rate of growth in the coming years. We continue to advance in our portfolio across all our businesses. Highlights during the quarter included LSAG launching two new LC/MS products in Agilent 6470B Triple Quad and the Agilent RapidFire 400 systems. Both products are in high throughput labs, driving productivity and superior resolution. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which is a new subscription service using instrument sensor technologies to provide data driven usage insights. This helps drive improved customer economics and lab productivity. While early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service. During the quarter, our PD-L1 assay was approved by the FDA for expanded use of non-small cell lung cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies. Our team is very proud of the role their company is playing in the global COVID-19 play. We are supporting COVID-19 research, testing and therapeutic of vaccine development. Our efforts in the global fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. We are accelerating efforts to make a difference in the battle against COVID-19 and have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize customer support. Let me close with few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. While there's still significant uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the July trend of gradual improvement in our business to continue into Q4. By region, China will continue to be a positive story for us and lead return to growth. Europe is starting to trend upward. The Americas are also expected to improve but at lower rate than China and Europe. Globally, improved lab access, increasing non-COVID-19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy are all positive signs. I remain absolutely convinced Agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a stronger position in the marketplace. Our continued focus action on four priorities, protect the team; support our customers; preserve our P&L and balance sheet; and our unwavering investment in growth are delivering. Entering Q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. Yes, this pandemic remains unpredictable. However, I am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and return to growth. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. Thanks for being on the call. I look forward to taking your question after Bob's remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then, I'll finish up with a framework for thinking about Q4. As with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns. So, we're not going to provide formal forward-looking guidance today. However, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing out in Q4. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. On a core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter, currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage points, while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth. As Mike talked about the regional performance, I'll speak to the end-market performance. In terms of our end markets, pharma grew 2% in Q3 against a very strong comparison of 13% from last year. Both, small and large molecule applications grew and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug development labs increased production and access. We experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical, as anticipated. Revenues declined 10%, primarily due to conditions in the U.S., driven by COVID-19-related disruptions to patient visits and diagnostic lab opportunities. Encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine testing throughout the quarter, especially in China and Europe, while the U.S. lagged. Chemical and energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. Revenues were generally flat sequentially with conditions largely similar to what we saw in Q2. As we've talked about previously, we expect this segment to ramp more slowly than others. The food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. We're seeing ongoing signals that the market in China has stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. The food market was just one of several bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in China, including growth in the low-teens for our pharma business. Our environmental and forensics business declined mid-single-digits against the double-digit compare and the academic and government segments declined mid-single-digits, while improving on a sequential basis in Q3. Strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closes. Now, let's turn to the rest of the P&L. I'm extremely proud of how the Agilent team has responded to the challenging environment. During the quarter, we continued our focus on managing expenses, while ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. These expense management actions we initiated last quarter were on full display in Q3. In addition, our customer engagement model using digital tools continued to gain traction, while also delivering savings in SG&A. As a result, operating margins of 23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenues. Gross margin at 55.1% was down 130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix, and higher logistics costs. However, strong cost management and operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the number we posted a year ago. From a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. In terms of capital spending, we spent $25 million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in Q2. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash. Also during the quarter, we took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short-term debt with a 10-year bond and a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio. As you know, we paused share buybacks in Q2, pending improvement in business conditions. In Q3, our visibility into business trends and cash flow improved, and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases late in the quarter. In the quarter, in total, we repurchase 360,000 shares for $33 million. Going forward, we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases, along with additional opportunistic buying. Our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on growth M&A opportunities, while also returning the cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As we look to Q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of this pandemic. However, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter. We generally expected trajectory of gradual improvement in business results to continue across all regions. Areas where we see a broader range of scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets, non-COVID diagnostic testing, especially in the U.S., and the general CapEx environment. The combination of these factors could result in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth. Also, as a reminder, the BioTek acquisition closed midway through Q4 of last year. So, the M&A impact in Q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point growth and currency is forecasted to be positive in the quarter. The low end of this range envisions COVID-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall in various geographies, limiting and in some cases, reversing the recovery gains we've seen in a period of time. In this scenario, one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia and other markets as continued tight cash management leading to lower CapEx spending in the U.S. and Europe. We hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know, we have plans in place in case this happens. The higher end of the range assumes continued recovery by region, building on what we have seen in July, with the biggest impact coming from the U.S. This would include a continual increase in elective medical procedures such as cancer screenings, as well as continued lab openings. This view would also include continued China momentum, along with the continued improvement in Europe and other areas in the Americas. Again, this is not guidance, but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for Q4. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery. With that, I'll turn over things to Ankur to direct the Q&A. Ankur?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Thanks, Bob. Robert, if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A, please?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey, Doug. How are you doing?
A_174770 2020-08-19 I’m doing well. Nice work in a tough environment. Can we maybe just start with a clean-up question right off the bat which is just about the prepared remarks. I don't think you quantified COVID-19 tailwinds in the quarter. Again, I may have missed that. But, it just would be helpful to get that so we could try to normalize there?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Sure, Doug. I touched on it briefly in my comments. So, there's two points of reported growth in Q3.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Okay. That’s great. And then, on China, just a couple, I'm just curious if you would share the exit rate. And as we look ahead, I know you're not guiding, I'm just wondering if you think based on what you're seeing, if you think that double-digit growth can be sustained, from here, at least a term. And then, specific on food, it’s great to see it return to solid quarter first time [Technical Difficulty] seeing some stabilization last quarter. Can the high-single-digit growth rate you saw this quarter be sustained moving forward, given favorable multiyear comparisons? Thank you.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey Doug. Thanks for those questions. So, just to make sure it came through the audience. The question was about our view on the growth rate of China for the rest of the year as well as can that high-single-digit growth rate in food be sustained. We think the answer is yes on both. We're really pleased with our performance in China. It was broad based. I tried to really accentuate that in my comments. We saw basically double-digit growth across all end markets in China. And we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for Q4 in China. And I have to say, Doug, it's wonderful we talking about China food from a different vector. We've been talking about it probably last 18, 24 months of one that will return to growth. We saw some early indications in Q2, we saw strong Q3, and we think that are all numbers probably sustainable for the rest of this year. Want to say something, Bob?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I would just say, Doug, to add, I mean, one of the things that was very positive about China was it was pretty consistent across the quarter, and in fact exited slightly higher than that overall 11%, but we saw solid growth all three months.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Mike or Bob, just maybe on the guidance here. If I step back, the third quarter guidance, down mid-single to down mid-teens, this down low-single was up, came well above expectations I would say, perhaps not surprising than peers, but nonetheless solid execution. Maybe Q4, down 4 to plus 1 implies declines. What’s the cause of declines, just given in light of performance? Is that that the minus 4 at the low end, is that assuming that Life Sciences [Technical Difficulty]?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Vijay, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that that is overly conservative. What that would imply is actually a retrenchment -- and in COVID-19 flare-ups here in the U.S. as we go back -- as we move into the fall, and you start seeing some elements of shutdown. So, we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. But, we wanted to provide, hey, that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth. Our July results -- or our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. And so, we're aiming to do better. But there's still uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth, so.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And Bob, I think it’s probably fair to say, the wildcard is United States, right?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes, absolutely.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And we were encouraged by the movement in PMIs. You probably noticed that. But, let's see how that translates into business in the coming quarter. And again, we have to keep in mind ourselves, as pleased as we are with the result we just delivered, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there because the virus is unpredictable at times.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean, if you looked at each one of the major markets, each one of the major markets got better in Q3 versus Q2 with the exception of the U.S., which we expected given kind of the state of affairs with the pandemic.
A_174770 2020-08-19 That helpful perspective. So, the minus 4 implies that things get worse. Was July flattish or positive? And I'm curious Mike that you mentioned NASD doubling up a while ago. I know, if you turn back the page, we were doubling capacity. So, is this now versus six months of a quadrupling capacity versus where we were last year? Is that the right way to think about the revenues going from 100, 200 to perhaps, is that the math here?
A_174770 2020-08-19 No, it's slightly different math. I think, we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our capacity. What we ended up doing is actually triggering the decision to initiate expansion earlier than we thought, just given the robust nature of the end market. And as well as we have worked our way to be able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same physical space. So, we are investing a little bit more capital than we initially thought. But, we're also building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume than our current train A. So, it's a really -- we thought it was really positive signal. And that’s why sent out the press release this morning, because we're super excited about our prospects here.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. And Vijay, let me kind of frame into kind of the numbers. What we were talking about is the Frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue. And we added capacity that more than doubles that $100 million to give you a frame of the numbers. So, it's not 100, 200, 400, it's 100, 200 and more than 300 to kind of give you a sense. And in terms of July, we actually came in with growth across all three groups in exiting in July.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 I’ll start with the COVID commentary. I guess, if I go back to last quarter, there was some talk about launching the serology test. You guys obviously have an installed base of real-time PCR instruments. We've got the questions that why you haven’t launched a PCR test. So, can you just talk a little bit about, how you think about those tailwinds going forward and how you think about your capabilities on diagnostics side?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Tycho, I'll make some initial comments and then the group presidents are kind of quiet today. So, I’ll pull Sam in here as well, to provide his perspective. But, we think that there's still tailwinds in front of us and now two points of growth, and we think we can sustain that at a minimum. That's why I tried to put fairly bullish comments about our stepped up efforts across the Company. Some of these things are going to take a little bit longer. We think there's still room for our own test of quality tests with some different features. But, I think maybe a few comments there, Sam, from your perspective?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Sure, Mike. Hi, Tycho. As you -- I think you’d have seen a good pickup in terms of our qPCR instruments, which are our Aria systems, as well as our bioreagents related to qPCR both reverse transcriptase master mixes. On the antibody side, we’ve definitely also seen an increase in IgA, IgG and those antibodies. In terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. So, more to share in due course.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And Tycho, I guess, what I’d just close off here is a broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play in multiple aspects of this COVID-19. Some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into revenue, right? So, if you're working with, say, a pharma partner or something in the therapeutic area, it may take a while for that to come to market. So, we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time. And we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio.
A_174770 2020-08-19 I guess, that's a good segue on the NASD expansion. Could you maybe draw to what degree that's tied to the COVID vaccine, and any updates from your add-on capabilities on APIs for mRNA or siRNA vaccines?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Do you want to take that one, Sam?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes, sure. No problem. Tycho, I'd start by reiterating a little bit of what Mike and Bob were talking about. It's interesting that it was just last June that we did a ribbon cutting and starting of the new Frederick, Colorado facility. And quite frankly, we've seen demand that exceeded our expectations, just 12 months ago. So, building really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider it, as we call it, training on steroids as our general. But, it is very-differentiated, both in throughput and the molecules it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we're able to do multiple iterations or types of siRNA or RNA. We're also actively looking at other different versions of molecules that are oligo based. Though I can't reveal the details, we have had a lot of interest related to COVID-19, all of those used for either COVID-19-related therapeutics or even for vaccines. So, I can say that we have started to work on some of those programs now.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. And maybe Sam to add. That being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to COVID-19. We have plenty of demand outside of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. And so, this is a broad-based capacity expansion.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And then, just last one, I know we don't have official guidance, but there's a framework for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter. As we think about C&E and then also pharma biotech, should we expect any kind of material change in either of those end markets for the coming quarter? I know, you talked about restoring activities for C&E. I wasn't sure if that was maybe a positive improvement in trajectory there?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Probably -- C&E is probably the one that's -- I would expect it to be pretty stable and that down 10ish percent -- 8% to 10% in that range. We do expect pharma to continue to improve. So that 2% certainly even in the low scenario would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of Q3.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And Tycho, the supply chain consideration and discussions still happen and it gets added a level of stability, albeit down to this -- into the space. And, again, as you look ahead for the future, this is an area where eventually it'll come back, and again, too early to call. But, I'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in pharma.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. The way to think about those reshoring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen through the order book, and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of investments are being made. So, that's more future looking.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 So, first question is just on NASD, [ph] it’s obviously strong in the quarter, but that would imply Dako and clinical business, obviously you pointed that out, it was down in the quarter. But that's a significant decline. Maybe just could you parse that out for us? What is -- it's the COVID impact, for sure, but is there anything beyond that in terms of the way market is fundamentally potentially shifting here to NGS maybe? And if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit of that, clarify? Thanks.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Happy to do so. So, it's all market, it’s all access to labs and patients going for the diagnostic test. So, it's real all market. I think, we're seeing different pace of pacing throughout the quarter. All of our geographies in the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in July, but it was down sharply in May and June, particularly in the U.S. And keep in mind also, we -- part of our business in our genomics front is so select into NGS-based diagnostic labs and for genetic disorders, for example, those tests aren't getting done either. So, it's really all market.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I was going to say, Puneet, actually if you bifurcate those two and look at our performance, actually, pathology performed better than NGS testing volumes, given what Mike was just talking about, as well as some of the academic institutions.
A_174770 2020-08-19 That's good point, Bob. Thanks.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Thanks for that. And if you could, I know you quantified it last quarter, Bravo contribution. I was wondering if you can provide that for Bravo Magnis liquid handling system, sort of how much of that contribution happened in the quarter?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. That's part of the story for our COVID-19 tailwinds. And I think probably the biggest contribution this quarter actually came from BioTek, Bob, if I remember correctly?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Between BioTek and Bravo.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Bravo. So, it's kind of like, now we like a one-two punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation. I’d also remind you, with the Bravo platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the tips that go with those liquid handlers.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Okay. And last one on just ACG. I mean, could you just elaborate on -- in these times, you mentioned, there are some larger contracts -- service contracts and likes that you’re getting into. Sort of what are those sort of COVID-driven, what's behind those and maybe if you can elaborate on geography there?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Puneet, happy to have Padraig jumping on here and provide his perspective on that. So, Padraig, in the call script I talk a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. So, why don’t you talk about that a little more detail?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. So, thanks, Mike. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which has seen a big uptick. And what we're seeing from customers is a large demand for sourcing from one vendor. And because of our capabilities in terms of the asset monitoring capability, relocation services and our core delivery services, which are extremely in strong demand. We're seeing a big uptick from large customers, and we expect that to continue as we go through the quarter, next quarter.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. And I was going to say that I think the geography Puneet is largely in the U.S., but there are some global opportunities as well. It’s really non-COVID-19 related. I mean, this is part of the core growth strategy for Padraig’s business to continue to expand our market share on the Enterprise Services front. And we're really delighted that we made some big pharma deals.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 So, a couple of questions. Very impressive margin expansion in the third quarter. How should we think about the operating margin into Q4? And then, I guess, how much of these costs are permanent removals versus what has to come back in '21?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Let me take that, Derik. It's great question and we certainly are very pleased with how the team has responded, as I mentioned before. As we talked about, a large amount of the cost, we have not done things like furloughs. We stabilized the team. We have not reduced base pay and things like that. So, these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them we think had the opportunity to stay away, be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our customers. And so, there aren't any kind of one time things that happened in the quarter. In terms of going forward to Q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy recovers. We also have some startup costs in the NASD new facility as well. So, it's probably less than what we've had historically had, which is call it 30% to 40% incremental. But it's really to drive growth.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey Bob, if I could maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. So, this is really, Derik, all about a new way of working in Agilent. So, I'm preparing for a manager's call later this week. And what we're talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. And we're really going to make sure that when we get on the other side of COVID-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our old ways of traveling. And we know from our customer satisfaction scores, they love the responses we have now with our digital platforms.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And two questions on LASG (sic) [LSAG]. I guess, the first question is, if you look at your numbers in China versus some of your major peers in that area, I mean, you really outshone in China. Can you just talk about just share dynamics there that are going on? I mean, as I said, there was a pretty stark comparison between you and your main LC competitor there. And I guess, also along those lines, can you talk about potentially any sign of a budget -- any sign of a budget flush into sort of thinking about 4Q trends? What are you hearing in terms of people with budgets? And are they going to be allowed to roll things over and to -- or are they going to have to use it or lose it? Just some dynamics in terms of growth on the fourth quarter and just sort of to your general thoughts on what customer spending habits are?
A_174770 2020-08-19 I'm going to have Jacob handle the first question. And Jacob, you can pass it back to Bob and I for the second question. And I know Jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share dynamics in China, which we think are very positive for Agilent?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Thanks for that. And the number speaks for itself. It's clear that both in China but I think actually globally that we right now will be taking care. And this doesn’t come like coincidence. We have been executing our strategy to make a deal over the past year. And the customers are really buying into our value proposition. We are playing a game where we are leveraging our whole portfolio, not going after one product line versus each other and the customer really likes that we’re outcome based. So that's what is happening right now. And we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about the investments we have done over the past year, but also, as Mike talked about, in the digital world, into the work world, we have been very optimistic and super responsive they have taken off the digital, we take challenge variable very, very good and the customers responded very, very positive to it. They know that when they work with Agilent that we are there for them in this crisis.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And then, on the other question, Derek, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in the public sector and we’re seeing it in our order book, and while I'll offer my perspective here, and feel free to build on my comments here. But, there's a real sense of making sure they commit to the budgets. So, we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there is a lot of uncertainty what's going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. So, they want to commit those funds. And it's actually quite amazing the amount of deal activity that's going to occur without visiting a customer face to face. So Bob, I don’t know what you're hearing from field…
A_174770 2020-08-19 The only thing I would add is just reiterate what Jacob was saying, because it's not just China. I think, when you look at our LSAG portfolio, I think what people don't fully appreciate is, is how we've actually changed the portfolio to technology platforms, they're probably the best -- in the best shape they have been in probably five years in terms of new products and so forth. And I think you're seeing that across the globe. And when we think about where we ended up in Q3, LSAG was certainly the standout relative to where we thought they were going to be. In a capital constrained environment only down 4% on a core basically speaks to our responsiveness to customers.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Bob, on the gross margin line, you mentioned higher logistics cost in the third quarter. Is that a new trend? And then, could you help us just think through some of the puts and takes, whether it's logistics costs or mix and how those puts and takes might evolve in the fourth quarter?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Sure. We’re hoping that's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was exacerbated in the Q3. That being said, I would say three quarters of that was probably mix, when you look at the various businesses across each one of the groups. But, where we saw logistics, challenges are, it's lower capacity and freight and air capacity. But we would expect that -- and we actually saw that through the quarter to kind of relax. And I think as you’re starting to see more intercontinental travel, both from a passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint we would expect that to kind of relax over time.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Okay. And then, Bob or Mike, you're not quite giving formal forward-looking guidance yet, but you do feel comfortable enough to restart the buyback program. Just what are your latest thoughts just around comfort as far as capital deployment goes and maybe your appetite for M&A right now and what the funnel might look like there?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Sure, Brandon. And I'll start off here, and Bob, feel free to jump in. But, we felt quite comfortable resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at opportunistic as well. And cash flow remains strong. We felt for some time that the third quarter of this year would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. We’re through that now. And the third quarter actually was significantly better than we had thought. And we saw positive growth across all the businesses in July. So, we think, okay, barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this gradual improvement of growth in the fourth quarter, sort of our message. So, we have the comp. We also narrowed the framework that we provided, it’s more narrower than it was in Q3. But again, I think we need to keep in mind ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the pandemic. I think, our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is, we certainly wanted a balanced approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash, share repos and with the prioritization of investment in business, we just made a significant commitment in capital with our new NASD expansion. And we're still on the hunt for deals that make sense for Agilent. So, our approach to capital deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. We paused a bit in the second quarter just because -- on the share repo because of the -- in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on in the environment outside of Agilent. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a reasonable level of confidence, and there is decent level of stability about the business.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 So, maybe just to circle back…
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey Dan.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hi Mike. So, maybe this is a question for Bob, talking again about the Q4 framework. So, if your business grew in July and the world improves month to month through October, what does that imply then the high end should be above that 1% organic growth number?
A_174770 2020-08-19 It could be. I'll just leave it at that. There's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. But certainly, we wouldn't complain if it was better than that.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Okay. And then, my follow-up, whoever wants to take it, on the NASD business. Can you elaborate on, what's the lead time for that announced expansion? Is it something that would take a year or multiple years to put in the new line, or is it a quicker turn? And can you comment on your willingness to commit capital inorganically in that business in addition to your organic commitments?
A_174770 2020-08-19 I'll take the first one just real quick. And then, Mike, if you want to add something on the second one. We announced that we would make that $150 million investment and we would expect it to go live towards the end of 2022. So, it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. Sam mentioned train A on steroids. So, it's bigger, and probably take a little more capital. And obviously with COVID-19 there's some activity there in terms of little long lead time. But, we feel like we have the capacity to be able to manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I think, it’s perhaps end of '22. And don’t specifically talk about specific targets or areas of focus, certainly, but it's not out of the realm of reason that I would say, why wouldn’t we want to further expand this business inorganically as well? So, that's not out of the realm. I'm not singling anything near-term happening. But we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this business. We had a first -- get our new factory up and running and build for that. So, we now think we have a, if you will, a beachhead to build from both, organically and inorganically.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 I guess, first, despite the relatively good LSAG results in the quarter, it sounds like the outlook on the capital equipment side is still a bit uncertain. Can you just talk to how the services and consumable side of the business trended in July, and what your expectations are for instrumentation trends in the coming quarters?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I think -- Catherine, this is Bob, all three of our businesses actually performed better in July than they did in May and June, which was very positive. The ACG business actually led the charge in terms of that, as you would expect, given the resumption of activities. There's some catch up there, in terms of -- we saw that kind of phenomenon actually in China, in April. But ultimately ACG was there. I think, LSAG capital is going to continue to be constrained. But I think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this in the past kind of this flight to quality. And with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, I think in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious. And we think our positioning is very good vis-à-vis the market.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I tried to hit that in my remarks, which as I really say, hey listen, we know we're picking up share in a tight market. And I think you saw that on C&E, right, which is if a C&E capital purchase is going down, it's coming Agilent’s way. And that's why -- and the market is still cautious, but you see PMI starting to creep up a bit, so.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes, Catherine, just one last thing, to give you maybe a little more color. If we look across the groups, we would expect LSAG to still be negative in Q4. I mean, it's probably going to lag, given the [Multiple Speakers] big fourth quarter last year as well.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And then, Mike, you mentioned seeing growth in all regions for the non-COVID diagnostics business exiting the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where those activity levels are in the U.S. versus China and where they bottomed out across the different regions?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Sure. So, I think, I’d say China is in lead position in terms of if you -- almost full recovery. Europe is second and the U.S. is trailing. So for the first -- throughout the quarter, if I look at Sam's business in the U.S., for example, the first two months were negative of diagnostic testing values in pathology. But we saw actually improvement to growth in July. So, I think that's sort of the pattern of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. China is back. Europe's on its way. And I'd say, U.S. is still in the early stages of recovery.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. And I would say, in the U.S. it’s probably -- and keep me honest, Sam it’s -- we're probably still at about 80% pre-COVID levels from a diagnostics perspective, but improving where it was. It was below that at the beginning of the quarter, so. Does that sound, Sam?
A_174770 2020-08-19 It does.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Just one question for you. A lot of my other questions have already been answered. 90 days ago, you made a brief comment about potential onshoring back in the U.S. Just was wondering if there's any update on that at all?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Thanks, Steve. Happy to comment on that. I think, that's still going to happen. And these things take time. But, there's active discussion. And, by the way, I wouldn't say it's just confined I the United States. I mean, many geographies are now looking at the security of their supply chain, both in the pharma side as well as in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the APIs for the pharma chains. So, there's nothing significant to announce relative to the impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend in this regard. And I can say also from an Agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our supply chain is secure as well. So, I think that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real wake up call to really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of supply chain. So, we're kind of working both sides of it, which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios, as well as we do see some market trends underway. Bob, I know you take a look at this pretty…
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. Just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. We would expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book. And that's probably more a ‘21 timeframe for revenue. I wouldn't expect any of that to happen in Q4, just given the kind of timing. But you're seeing it in multiple end markets in multiple regions. We think this is a trend that will continue.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Maybe first question just on chemical and energy, obviously, you've already highlighted a few comments throughout the call. But just wondering if you can kind of walk through a little more color separate trends within that segment by customer in chemical and if it's worth seeing if there's going to be divergence here between chemical and A&P and R&M? And then secondarily, maybe just remind us of how much of that business is tied towards like QA/QC versus R&D and kind of what are we looking for to determine whether or not this down 10% begins to improve more reliably, or if it's going to save the slow steady progress that you believe?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey, Bob, why don't I make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if I missed anything. But, I think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- and I think both the chemical and the energy later side had about the same dynamics where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument side. And on one hand, the chemical side of the business was really benefiting -- continues benefit from the low oil prices. But, some of their end markets are weak, whether be automotive or some of the other markets that they service are weak. Some of them are getting a little bit of help on COVID-19 related products. But overall, I'd say both, the chemical side, as well as the energy side of that are down about the same, but stable. And I have to say that Bob and I had talked to at some length about this in our last call. And our prediction at the time was we thought we were going to be in a stable situation relative to this. That wasn’t going to get any worse. That was sort of the question we were getting last call. So, I think we're really pleased to see that that came through this quarter. And we expect that eventually this thing will start to move back to grow. I think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it’s in QA/QC. And that's why these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. So, QA/QC equipment will be needed as well as consumer services that go with it. So, they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long. There is an element of research. But I think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that is the QA/QC side of the business.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. And the only thing I’d add, Dan is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slow progress going forward.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Okay. And then, maybe one different follow-up, I know -- a couple of questions on China. But maybe could you just go a little bit more into detail on what you saw in food and generics? Obviously COVID is impacting the globe and the recovery. But, you've got some pretty unique issues with food and generics that are maybe a little different. So, dependent upon the improvement or lack thereof, that could drive notable changes in China. So, what did you see there? And what's the outlook as we look forward to those segments?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I was going to say, Dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in China was all three of the business groups grew and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. It's been a while since we've been able to say that. And so, we think that -- we talked about kind of the moves away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs, and we think that that's stabilized, and team has really been able to garner share, or our view of capacity in that space. And then, in pharma, it continues to perform very well. Actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in China, and that's a combination of both, large and small molecule. And I think that our thesis around that continues to play out, which is that the winners of the 4 plus 7 or the tendering process are -- customers that where we are over indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from Q2 to Q3 in both, food and pharma, and the rest of the businesses were positive as well. So, I think, it’s broad-based.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Mike, maybe just one for you on -- I know, there’s been a few questions in July obviously. But with all the businesses returning to growth, I guess, is it safe to assume you guys didn't see too much of a pullback around the second wave here in the U.S., even the first few weeks of August? It sounds like you're a little more cautious on Americas versus other geographies. But, just wondering, any surprises on an end market basis in the U.S., as you went through July and even early August, given the reoccurrence of virus?
A_174770 2020-08-19 No, I'll jump in on this. But from our perspective, I don't know real surprises. Maybe we're -- like all of us are watching what was happening with the pandemic as it worked its way across throughout the U.S. and we saw the case numbers go up and lab access was down for the early really sharply April, May, June and we started seeing some recovery. So, I think no real surprises versus what we thought.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I would agree. I mean, Patrick, this is Bob. The Americas, as Mike said earlier, is in fact the biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both Europe and China. And I think, the thing that we're watching is those COVID flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which would impact our diagnostics business. That's probably got the biggest variability going into Q4 relative to LSAG and ACG. But, to Mike's point, we did not see any significant change with these flare-ups in August -- or excuse me in July and early August.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And then, bunch of that good commentary on the chemical and energy and industrial side. Just want to and just clarify, I mean it certainly seems like the industrial sentiment feels like it might have bottomed. It seems like your tone is little bit better from three months ago. You know again, chemical and energy is probably going to be down similar this quarter and again next quarter. But, I guess what you're hearing from customers there on spend plans? Again, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic and talking a little more bullishly about '21. So, I'm just wondering, I guess, as we enter into the end of this fiscal year into '21, are you seeing things improve a little bit? Obviously, you’ll come up against very easy comps, but it does seem like the tone is a little more positive. So, are you hearing from customers, things that are trending a little bit better into '21?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. I think that's a fair assessment of what I was trying to communicate today. First of all, the fact that we do think it's bottomed. And that was our thesis when things started going directly down and the pandemic hit. So, we do see that. Again, I don't want to get too far out and describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. But, customers are working on the plans. Chevron actually is making some big investments in Iraq. So capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the highest capabilities. So, we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. I think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling more clarity in their view where the economy's gone, then they can make their decisions a lot more confidence. So, the PMIs are good view of how some of them may be changing. So, again, don't over interpret this for fourth quarter, but it does point to '21 being perhaps a better environment.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.
A_174770 2020-08-19 So, I wanted to go back to the NASD business and just get a little bit more color. Are you working on any of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine? I guess, curious because the trials are going so quickly. I was curious to get your take if one [indiscernible] and into commercial within the next six months, how would you manage the business to deliver on the capacity that customer might need for that?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey, Sam, I’m going to pass that to you.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. no problem, Mike. So, I can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecule of the projects that we're doing related to COVID-19. But, two things I will point out. As Bob indicated earlier, this is business separate for or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business, if you will. And we believe, we have the capacity and that's -- if the demand is there related to certain things playing out related to COVID-19 and the molecule that we happen to be working on, we believe we will be in a position to be able to supply that material as the volume required.
A_174770 2020-08-19 And then, one more follow-up on LSAG. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the research labs around the globe, kind of in this conversation around deferral versus cancellation, what are customers telling you? Is it still mostly deferrals versus cancellations? And on the deferral side, when do you expect these, how far out is it getting pushed something that you think it hits before the end of the year or probably more likely in calendar '21?
A_174770 2020-08-19 Hey Jack. Happy to answer this question. This is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals versus cancellations. And we've really been pleased, our cancellations are actually lower than last year. And our thesis is they’re being pushed and actually funds will be deployed this calendar year.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. That's what we actually -- we saw that -- Jack, some of that actually happen in Q3. And as people are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. But to Mike's point, we've seen no cancellation -- or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. There's always some level of it. I would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased. And I would expect it to happen this calendar year.
A_174770 2020-08-19 This concludes the allotted time for our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ankur for any closing remarks.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Yes. So, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everyone for joining us.
A_174770 2020-08-19 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
