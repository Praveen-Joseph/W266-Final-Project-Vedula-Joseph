       "  '2008-10-22 22:14:12'): \"Good morning. My name is Candis. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Applied Biosystems' First Quarter Fiscal 2009 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Following the speakers' presentations, there will a question-and-answer session period. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Mr. Peter Dworkin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Applied BIosystems. Mr. Dworkin, you may begin your conference.Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining Applied Biosystems management to discuss the first quarter fiscal 2009 financial results that we issued earlier this morning. Present today are: Tony White, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Winger, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Stevenson, President and Chief Operating Officer. Also with us today are other senior managers and Investor Relations Director Bill Craumer. A reminder that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about Applied Biosystems' business. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our business that are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in Applied Biosystems' filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release and on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website at www.appliedbiosystems.com. On July 1, 2008, all of the businesses, assets, and liabilities of the Celera Group were separated into an independent publicly traded company known as Celera Corporation, and the Applied Biosystems Group became our only business. Accordingly, amounts for prior periods have been restated to reflect the Celera business as discontinued operations. A reminder that on June 11, 2008, Applied Biosystems entered into a definitive merger agreement with Invitrogen Corporation, pursuant to which Invitrogen will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied Biosystems stock. On Monday this week we issued a press release to clarify that the adjournment last week of the special stockholders' meetings to October 28 does not invalidate proxies or merger elections that have been voted. We also saw in that press release to clarify the deadlines for Applied Biosystems stockholders to make their elections regarding the consideration to be received in the merger, as there has been some confusion on that point in the broker community. So please see that on this release if you have questions about these issues. And now I'd like to turn the call over to CEO, Tony White.Good morning, everyone. This was another solid quarter for Applied Biosystems. We are pleased with the continuing growth in our consumables product lines, which is up 7% compared to the prior year. The Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, was again our outstanding performer, with increased revenues of 38% compared to the prior year quarter. Consumables continued to grow as a percent of total sales and most impressive was the EPS... GAAP EPS was $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS was 48%, which is actually up 55% compared to prior year. Regarding our merger with Invitogen, I'm pleased to say that, based on the votes that are tabulated to-date stockholders of both companies have demonstrated overwhelming support for the merger. Teams from both Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen have been working diligently on the integration activities. Mark 0Stevenson and Greg Lucier have championed this process from the beginning. Process has been quite rigorous. Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen currently expect the merger to close in mid November, subject to stockholder approvals expected at the October 28 special meetings, regulatory clearance from the European Union, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. I expect this to be the last earnings conference call for Applied Biosystems prior to completion of the merger. It's been a privilege to lead this company since 1995, and I want to thank our shareholders, as well as our employees, customers, and most importantly, my colleagues for the support that you've given me over the years. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark Stevenson to talk about the quarter.Thanks, Tony, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I'd like to reinforce what Tony said about the integration. The process is going smoothly, and we're all truly looking forward to day one of the new company. When we announced this combination in June, we asserted that until close, it would be business as usual, and it has been. We've executed well to close the last fiscal year and we followed it up with a strong first quarter of 2009, albeit with notable weakness in mass spectrometry. It's been an extremely productive quarter. Each of our major product areas introduced at least one significant new product during the quarter. Unfortunately, some of those announcements came in the midst of one of the biggest financial market disruptions in history, relegating Applied Biosystems to page two. It's my job today to try to bring them back to page one and give some context to some of the quarter's activities and financial results. Let me start with DNA sequencing, up 9% over the prior year quarter. Our CE systems were up slightly during the quarter, led principally by our HID forensics installations. Consumables in our CE systems were down as high-throughput research customers continued to transition, as we expected, to next-generation sequencing. SOLiD systems sales grew strongly. Earlier this month, we announced the SOLiD 3 System. SOLiD 3 is expected to further extend the industry leading accuracy and throughput capabilities of this next-generation sequencing platform, while providing streamlined workflows. SOLiD 3 is expected to lower the cost of sequencing an entire human genome to less than $10,000, a level that should catalyze new research to understand the cause, diagnosis and potential treatment of complex diseases. In addition, Applied Biosystems Software Development Community has begun to accelerate deployment of application-centric software tools, to enable even higher user productivity. We also announced two SOLiD-optimized kits for the analysis of small RNAs and transcriptome-wide expression profiles. We're very excited about these offerings because they build off the best-in-class RNA capability acquired in our 2006 purchase of Ambion. They will also further reduce run times and simplify workflows for customers. We've also introduced barcoding methods that will enable the analysis of up to 256 samples in parallel in a single run, with per-sample costs below and information content higher than what would... one would achieve in array-based gene expression work. Just as encouraging, we're seeing an increasing number of scientific publications based on research conducted on the solid system, underscoring the accuracy and cost savings achievable with our technology platform. One such example appeared in the September issue of Genome Research. Investigator sequenced a yeast genome on AB's SOLiD system and on a competitive short-read system. It was determined that a researcher would have to sequence a sample 19 times on the competitive platform, to achieve the same accuracy and coverage achievable with just 10 times on the SOLiD platform. Quick word about CE technology which continues to be the gold standard in applications such as molecular testing and forensics. On September 27, both Chambers of the Congress sent the Debbie Smith DNA Reauthorization Act to the President, which he signed last week. It authorizes continued funding of up to $151 million between government fiscal year 2010 and fiscal 2014 for forensic DNA backlog reduction. We report Human Identity kits in the Real-Time and Applied Genomics category, so this is a good time to transition into this category. A 38% of revenue and a 13% year-over-year growth rate compared to our strong comp in the prior year quarter, this category is the largest part of our portfolio. In this category are PCR-based research consumables, such as TaqMan assays, our Ambion products, our consumables kits for DNA forensics, as well as our PCR-based sequence detection systems. Instruments and consumables both delivered strong growth in the first quarter, and instruments enjoyed revenue as well as unit sales growth. The end of September, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our new 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument. This instrument was cleared concurrently with the new CDC Real-time PCR Flu Panel. The test delivers answers within four hours, aiding public health officials in making rapid and accurate diagnoses. This is an important milestone for Applied Biosystems in our journey to support our customers in validated and regulated markets. Our Ambion product line, once again, showed double-digit growth in the first quarter, driven by Silencer Select siRNAs, sample prep products, and animal health solutions, which enable detection of common pathogens in livestock. Yesterday, we announced the introduction of our TaqMan OpenArray genotyping system, developed out of our collaboration with BioTrove. The new system is designed to enable us to compete in a new segment of the high-throughput genotyping market. Customers will be able to leverage the speed and accuracy of TaqMan technology for screening and validation applications in fast-growing markets, such as disease association studies and understanding drug treatment response as a function of individual genotype in clinical studies. Last quarter's (sic) [year's] first quarter results included some real-time PCR licensing revenue, whereas in Q1, 2009 a similar level of non-recurring royalty revenue was recorded in our core PCR category. Because of the similar level of these royalties, there was a little impact on gross margin year-on-year. However, the revenue impact of the royalties booked in Q1, 2009 on our core PCR category, which was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter was significant. Our mass spectrometry business was quite frankly challenged in the first quarter, and product revenues in this category declined nearly 10% compared to the prior year quarter. The slowdown was primarily attributable to three factors: contraction of capital spending for mass spectrometry in our core small-molecule pharma market, which is part of a function more outsourcing to CROs; purchase delays ahead of our new product introductions; and competitive pressures. We believe we are sustaining share in the mass spec pharma market, but the tightening in the market had a significant impact. Mass spec sales were down in every major geographic region with the exception of Asia-Pac outside of Japan. Applied markets and proteomics sales were relatively flat. On a more positive note, and something many of you have been anticipating, we launched in early October two new mass spec systems based on a very powerful next-generation platform that enables workflow solutions, we believe, will be unmatched in terms of sensitivity, scan speed, and functionality. The new platform, which we have branded AB SCIEX, incorporates a host of innovations in a footprint that is 44% smaller than its predecessor. The first two systems built on the new platform are the Triple Quad 5500 and the QTRAP 5500. QTRAP 5500 offers the pharmaceutical industry groundbreaking a much-needed capabilities in application areas, such as drug metabolite identification. We're also targeting the protein quantitation market, particularly in the area of multiplexed biomarker protein verification and validation. The Triple Quad 5500 is expected to become a mainstay in food and water analysis due to its ability to identify and confirm more than 1000 different chemicals in a single test, a level that is unmatched in the industry. When Applied Biosystems says launch, we really mean launch. We have trained our sales people and support personnel around the world. We have inventory. We have orders. And we have shipped to our first customers. Let me close by, again, thanking all AB employees for working with remarkable diligence and delivering very solid performance this quarter, the last quarter we expect to report prior to the close of the merger. We're looking forward to joining with Invitrogen and executing on the promise of the new company. With that, let me turn it over to Dennis Winger.Thank you, Mark. As mentioned, our first quarter results were highlighted by solid revenue growth and continued strong EPS growth on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to the prior-year quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 60.5% compared to 55.8% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin benefited from lower enzyme costs and favorable product mix along with a payment from Department of Defense related to a terminated Air Force contract. We also enjoyed favorable currency effects of roughly 0.4%. During the first quarter, SG&A increased to $160.3 million or 30.1% of revenues, from $149.4 million, or 29.8% of revenues, in the prior year quarter. The increase was due mostly to the unfavorable impact of currency and employee-related costs. R&D expenditures decreased to $49.3 million, or 9.2% of revenues in the first quarter, compared to $50.6 million, or 10.1% of revenues, in the prior year quarter. First quarter of 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis were $0.48, an increase of approximately 55% compared to $0.31 on a restated basis in the prior year period. Excluding foreign currency, non-GAAP earnings per share increased approximately 48% over the prior year quarter. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release, as well as on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website, www.appliedbiosystems.com. Cash flow from continuing operations during the first quarter was $73.8 million and capital expenditures were $15.3 million. At the end of the first quarter, trade accounts receivable were $384.2 million, representing 57 days outstanding, and inventory was $175.8 million, representing 4.5 months on hand of inventory. I should mention here that despite a very conservative approach to investing our excess cash, during the quarter we recorded a $2.9 million loss related to our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund in the U.S that is currently in liquidation as a result of having unsecured commercial paper from Lehman Brothers in its portfolio. The remaining balance of our investment in this fund, totaling $97 million, has been reclassified from cash and short-term investments to other receivables to reflect the illiquid nature of this investment. We have similarly reclassified to other receivables $15 million that was invested with a Dutch branch of Landsbanki, an Icelandic bank that has been nationalized and has suspended repaying creditors. We may need to recognize an additional loss in a future quarter once all of the issues with these investments have been resolved. At of the end of the quarter, cash and short-term investments were $368 million, down from $543.2 million as of June 30, 2008. This decrease was largely the result of the reclassification of the two illiquid investments and loan repayments associated with the accelerated share repurchase program completed in fiscal 2008. Finally, as explained in the press release, in view of the pending merger with Invitrogen, we are not updating the outlook for fiscal 2009 that we provided in July at the start of the fiscal year. We'll now be happy to take your questions. Question And AnswerThank you, sir. This begins the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first will come from the line of Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.Good morning, guys. This is actually Mann [ph] for Quinn, congratulations on a solid quarter here.Thank you.First question, I guess maybe for Mark. Thank you for the color on the CE consumable trend. I mean just with respect to that and as the transition happens in next-gen sequencing I mean are you starting to see a leveling out here? Or I mean how much further switching to the next-gen do you guys really anticipate near term?In the near term we continue to expect a decline in the key business. We've anticipated that, that will be in the low single-digit. And that's the kind of decline we're seeing. What's going on is the high throughput customers and particularly the applications of de novo sequencing that's been going on for some couple of years now, certainly switching to next generation technologies and more comparative sequencing going on using techniques like the SOLiD to follow-up on the initial study. That's only the switch we anticipate. Now clearly at some point in the future and we're not predicting that at the moment, as we install more medium, a lot throughput systems and applications such as the forensic and some of the clinical applications, we still have growth in that segment. But in the foreseeable future at the moment, we continue to expect a decline offset by the growth, obviously a next-gen from SOLiD.Thank you for that color. And then just my second question, it's really on the new 5500 mass specs. I mean are there any color on the initial customer reaction that you've seen with these early shipments here? Thank you.This is Laura Lauman. And I'll be glad to answer that. Yes, we've seen very positive response from our customer base, those for the 5500 QTRAP and the Triple quad as you know, it falls into a host of application areas, including protein quad, the metabolite ID work as well as pesticide for food and environmental testing. We've had very strong response from our customer base, and actually don't need time to demo the instrument and understand how their step of work on their instruments, but the initial response has been very positive.Thank you, again.Our next question will come from the line of Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank, please proceed.Hi good morning gentlemen. In terms of the mass spec side of the business, the weakness there has been sort of persistent for some time. If you sort of had to couch it in terms of market versus product away... delays relative to new product introductions, relative to competition in terms of percentage impact, how would you do so? And then in terms of your comments around the CRO customer base, there was obviously a large deal recently with Lilly and Covance, they got a bit oppressed. I mean as we see things similar to that and see more of that, there are going to be talks [ph] that's being kind of outsourced, how should we think about that customer base from a purchasing standpoint relative to the pharma customer which has traditionally been the end market base there for a while of the product?I can take that question as well, it's Laura Lauman. Yes we did have a challenging quarter this quarter clearly. I think it's reflective certainly in the pharmaceutical business as a whole, which has been contracting particularly in the PK area and outsourcing to CROs globally. We've seen a lot of outsourcing particularly into China, Asia region which is really the reason for our very substantial growth for us there. But that has been offset by what's happening in the U.S. and the Western European market. I think also and it's been pretty well discussed... customers new that we were introducing new products, we actually under CDA talked to about 30 different customers in advance of the launch, just letting them know it was coming. So I think also there has been a slowdown as or selling in the market as a result of that which is natural given two new product introductions. So I really see it... the majority of business is the combination of those two factors. In terms of CROs, we continue to be strong in that market as we are in the PK market. That's been always a very solid base for us, and we continue to sell in to both those categories even in this kind of difficult pharmaceutical contraction. I hope that helps.That was great, well thanks. And Mark, relative to sort of your comments around the legacy CE business specifically on the consumable side, competitors have been more noise at recent industry conferences regarding advancements relative to REIT lands and kind of cost improvements specifically on the four-by-four side. I mean what do you think what need to happen in terms of any of the competitive instruments to potentially accelerate the kind of displacement cycle in the smaller laboratories of the 3730 base? Or do you just think that at least for the time being there is kind of a core utilization that there's scientific limitations of some of those competitive technologies that they might never be able to get there at least in the mind of a scientist?Yes Ross I mean, we continue to see the change in the market and really it's not so much you can't specifically do the REIT less [ph]. You get certain projects and the research quarter, in fact 3730 businesses was actually stronger than we expected this quarter where people continue to be demand for applications where they have a sample that they want to run. And just click at a small amount of sequence. And it is just very easy and simple to set up. So, we do that in a small core lab. It's not really the large de novo sequencing genome project that are going on. It's much more a question of easy of use, simplicity or proximity to the technique that's well proven. And that goes on in small labs around the world and we continue to see demands of that. But we have also participated in where there has been excess demand offering to use and pre-own instruments, when we see good demand for that as well. It's really not as much as a technology question, it's different experiment that they want to do ways of use that's important to them.So, I guess is that the kind of the key part of differentiation where you think that CE, just because it's been around for so long and people are so comfortable with it. That is kind of the key differentiator versus some of these newer technologies which might have different bells and whistles. They don't offer anything that kind of either moves the needle or not to sort of get people away from what they've been doing for 10 years. Is that kind of sort of what you're trying to say? I just want to make sure of that.I'll let Shaf Yousaf give out a bit more color as he digs a bit deeper, Shaf.I think when you contrast the two different technologies, next-gen sequencing is really addressing a different question, while you set up to do a run is substantially more complicated and therefore to do a large experiment to generate large amount of data, there is a different kind of genome scale question being asked. Gene sequencing is the gold standard for small projects and then for accurate long relent kind of approaches and remains to... we expect that to remain... as we look forward we normally segment the customer base by categories. And again we said very clearly in the genome centers we are seeing the strongest transitions. In the other categories, in the callouts and so on there still seems to be ongoing demand for the use of CE for the projects that they're seeing.All right. Great, thank you Shaf. That's all for me.Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Groberg of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a good quarter. I just had a couple of clarifying questions, I guess. One, can you maybe, Mark, talk about keep... outside of your company keep talking about the fact that you guys are giving away instruments, continues to be like kind of noise and rumor. Can you just maybe where you are in terms of revenue recognition? I was trying to run some numbers back of the envelop here in terms of instrument growth but maybe where are you in terms of revenue recognition for the SOLiD and kind of how orders and you got a lot of orders you mentioned last quarter and how those have held up going into this quarter as well?Well, I think you can see Jonathan as we report out the revenue growth of 9% we're talking about CE declining, that clearly we're recognizing revenue from instrument with pricing, revenue growth is in that growth. We've had as I commented tremendous placements of SOLiD that exceeded our expectations for this third quarter. We continue to recognize the revenue. So, it's not a matter of I hate questions of people saying that we're giving the instruments away then so how you recognize revenue. So, there is no point to going on, what we certainly do is make sure before the customer recognizes the revenue, they place some orders with us, we have expectance criteria, we place them on sites, we install them, we support them. The training process is going tremendously well. We're just training up our service engineers to the upgrades as well, we have 70 service engineers, field service engineers in addition to our FAS field application support supporting our customers which all of the 40 people in the field taking out and supporting the upgrades that will go through and we'll recognize revenue on the upgrades as well. That's the process we are going through, and we are very pleased with the acceptance criteria as customers go through that process.And just to clarify a little bit more, one, maybe some qualitative commentary around the order growth from last quarter and into this quarter, and then two, I think you have mentioned in the past some goals as to where you would like to move revenue recognition towards in terms of matters of once a week, so maybe just kind of where are you at there?Yes certainly when we first put the version out, we think just over a year ago, we put the first system out, we launched the SAT [ph], we made tremendous progress in the system. We were estimating to do about 90 days to go through that process. We are now down to less than 60 days, and we are working a way down. We are getting new procedures and how we install and test the instruments in manufacturing. We have increased throughputs in manufacturing and that's being successful for us and the order flow has been good. I get questions about funding for next-generation sequencing, funding is good, customer make available money for that. And so we are seeing good demand in both of the key application areas both for the sequencing applications, disease focused and for increasing the gene expression application.And I think you in the past you gave actually a number in terms of order wins that you thought you were getting, have you seen any change in that over the last few months, few... a couple of three moths or so?Well there is no significant change. We don't think that was a milestone metric we updated at the end of our fiscal year. We're going to continue to report to the revenue category, but we're still in line with that rate we gave.Okay. And then on the consumable side, could you maybe, I know your line... significant numbers, maybe just help quantify a little bit more if you would have excluded the CE consumables, what your consumable growth would have been?Yes, Jonathan, we're not going to break out each. It's a category of a business. We think we give a lot of color to that. We expect the consumables if placements go, further and further increase, we certainly... one of our focus areas is on the software tools because we have people get up and running and as they get through this tremendous amount of data obviously we have to use that data and then improve the ease of use is our focus and then the consumable pull-through will happen as part of that. So that's how you can think about modeling that. Over time that ratio of instrument consumables will set a change.Okay. And the last question on gross margins. Dennis, I think you mentioned a couple of things or maybe could you provide a little more detail in terms of the expansion, how much what was due to the new enzymology, some of them might have been product mix because mass spec was down. You mentioned the FX helped I think 0.4 percentage points and you've got the payments from the Department of Defense. Could you maybe break out a little bit more how very strong gross margin just kind of what were the relative contributors?No, we can't give more detailed than we already have. Obviously currency was not a very impact. Mass spec was lower, as you know margin on mass spec is lower than other product lines, we share the product with our partner from Canada. That was a local portion of sales did have a positive impact on gross margin, and you have to take it, probably quantify that. And of course, we did have the payment from the Department of Defense. So those are the keys factors following the enzyme.Just maybe I have think we're positive about this recurring, the enzymes probably are greater effort to reduce cost of sales in that product. And we continue to have black-belt lean efforts goings on, reducing cost of that product. And we are also introducing more consumables products with our new enzymes, we think all of that is sustainable and part of the gross margin. So we're pleased about the effort we've made in that and that's a sustainable process. And we pull out that one-time items to benefit.Yes, thanks a lot.Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed.Hey, good morning.Good morning.Mark, I am just wondering if you can give a little bit more clarity on for SOLiD. I think internationally you've talked about placements in Russia and Brazil and some of these markets. Can you just talk a little qualitatively about how the international market for SOLiD is playing out?Yes, we continue to see increasing demand outside of the U.S, really we've given that color to, I don't think the question, will it adjust in the genome expenses? And the answer is no. We see it in countries, increase in the outside the U.S both in Western Europe, Japan, we see funding. Well funding was weak in Japan this quarter we're optimistic of funding flowing through like next-generation sequencing. We mentioned that success we've had is for genome institute scaled up more in SOLiD. So it's an increasing portion of our business. The U.S. is still the major focus for us in terms of orders at this time, but as we leverage the scale of AB's operation outside of the U.S., we expect we're going to do very well in our win rate outside the U.S.And with regards to the 3.0 how should we think about maybe the market, upgrade potential? I mean just maybe this in terms of percentage of the installed base you expect to upgrade over the coming year.We will expect the majority of our upgrade probably 100% who want to upgrade the system. When we started with these customers, we said to them they were on a journey as we've been on a journey through investing in SOLiD, so we would want to see all our customers upgrade. We set the price of the upgrade at $20,000 which allows our customers to very much be affordable to this upgrade and go with the generation so if look you look version 3, as we look beyond version 3, you'll see how customers continue to upgrade to the systems with a very scalable technology and so we expect a 100% will upgrade.Okay. And then with regards to the Invitrogen acquisition yesterday, of Invitrogen, is there any of color you can provide? You guys have obviously had an equity investment in there before you did the Agencourt deal?Yes, it's really for Invitrogen to comment on the details. I think they gave a couple of comments yesterday around with that program, around IV and embryology. I mean really as we look forward to the new company, clearly one of the growth... areas of growth will be next-generation sequencing. And we expect to be a leader in genetic analysis across all the technologies which will be both CE based technology, which will be SOLiD technology and which will be single molecule sequencing systems, and we expect that will be an opportunity for the new company going forward.Okay, in your release you talked a little bit about the FDA purchase of the 4000 QTRAPs for food testing, can you give us a sense as to where we are kind of in the regulatory landscape and you've talked in the past about this dynamic between FDA doing more food testing versus DOA, how do we think about kind of the opportunity there?Yes I think the question is who is regulating food testing? I mean what's certainly you see with the FDA in the case of the mass spec order certainly concerned about pesticides which impact human health. Before we've seen the USDA regulating, and so they tend to be more concerned about on the food side than the human health side. So we're certainly seeing both active, what AB certainly view is we want to continue to work with both our customers and the regulators, be it the FDA, the USDA, the other authorities around the world, as we move into these more validated markets. We are upgrading in-house quality systems. Applied Biosystems has a reputation for robust and reproducible systems. So we see good opportunities as we move into these more validated markets and that's certainly a focus for us.Okay. And then just one last one on a Flu Panel, are you shipping that now and can you talk maybe about how we think about seasonality there over the next couple of months?Yes the seasonality really depends on the outbreaks of the flu, it's exactly a panel that actually the CDC have developed and ship on to our system, into the CDC health labs. We've started shipping instruments with the 75,000 both in the U.S. but also internationally in countries like Africa who have partnerships with the CDC and whether CDC do early out-breaks of monitoring, so you see that come forward, as well, we will be upgrading our systems in the field through our service network and operating service contract and validations to upgrade the systems to the 7500 Fast version which is then the version we have, our first 510(k) equivalent. We're going to expect that to continue to go forward as we go forward. Clearly we're not hoping or wishing for an outbreak of avian influenza with the level of surveillance going on.Okay, thank you very much.Our next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard with First Analysis, please proceed.Thanks for taking my call. Question for Dennis, Dennis, I could still use a bit more help on understanding your gross margin performance in the quarter. I thought that lower enzyme cost was a benefit that anniversaried, as if something you guys have been talking about for many quarters now, is that just not the case? And it is something that will continue to provide year-over-year benefits on a go forward basis?As Mark referenced earlier, we continue to make progress in lowering our manufacturing costs. So there is an ongoing benefit which continues to exist, do you want to comment further Mark?Yes I would also say we also cleared that we didn't just saw some one enzyme supplier, as well as one that is anniversary, there was a second one that is coming on line. And we also have this impact of switching to our own enzymes. So we certainly anniversaried the first switch with the second one and third again as Dennis highlighted a multiple programs that continues to drive our cost status of some of the programs if you look at all our suppliers, if you look at all the components we manufacture, so that's where the benefit came.Okay. And then Mark you provided some color on the growth in the core PCR business. Why did the other products category grow as much as it did in the first quarter?We have a mixture of product lines in that other category. One is the separation products, that OSD that we supply to the biopharmaceutical industry. That business tends to be a little lumpy sometimes, it's a continued grower through from year-to-year. And so within that bio-production area, we had a strong quarter with business from customers out there in the U.S and in Europe.Okay. And then my final question for Laura. Laura, I am trying to think about how tease apart one of the factors you talked about mass spec weakness, which was the customers were holding off orders ahead of the new product launch. And when I go back to 2005, you introduced the API 5000 in January, but the quarter previously you grew that business 10%. So how do you try to tease out that headwind given that at least in some historical examples it doesn't appear to have been a meaningful headwind?Let me help Laura a little bit while she is kind of clicking through issues. This is one where we didn't introduce the new product at a major even like an ASMS meeting or something like this, which is sort of an off cycle introduction. And so there was a certain amount of time between those events, and when we actually did launch the products, that people were expecting us to do something new that it was coming. And I think that has had one of those effects on the market that people who really starting to question, when is this going to happen? So it's a little different from the normal cycle to do these things. First of all, we are not going to attribute the slowdown this quarter entirely to that. There are issues in the marketplace as well. But my sense and I'm just trying to watch in this thing was that this was like a slow motion crash between not be in ready to introduce the product at ASMS and when we actually did it.Okay.I think that's fair to just add on Tony's comment, for the API 5000 when we introduced that and you are right we did do it in January. We did not say prior to that, that we were coming out with the new product. We have talked about it several times certainly alluding to it, and I think the buzz in the industry is clearly there. Having said that and I think I mentioned it earlier, the pharma business is under considerable pressure right now. And I think that's been well noted in the press. So given that is air portion of our business also had an impact.Okay, that's helpful. Thank you both.Our next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please proceed.Hi, good morning. First question is on mass spec. I recognize that you're not updating guidance across the company given where you are relative to the closing of the Invitrogen deal, but considering the weak mass spec performance in the quarter, and given that you just launched a couple of new products, and we're tensely aware of the current capital environment. Would you be at least willing to provide some guidance specific to mass spec as we look forward over the balance of the fiscal year?Doug, I wouldn't be open to providing forward-looking statements on what the mass spec business will do. But I will say that as I mentioned earlier that customer response to the new products have been very positive. It really allows the customer now to identify very low level of metabolites, pesticides, peptides, whatever the application is and both quantify as well as identify what those analites are. And that's really a breakthrough, it's new in the industry to have this level of sensitivity and to be able to do both in one systems. So I must say that the feedback has been very strong, and we are... we do have units globally in our demo labs. We are currently demo-ing, we are fully booked for demos. So I think the response, as I mentioned, has been positive, and we'll see how it goes in our upcoming quarters.Okay, understood. Mark, a follow up on, I think it was John's question from earlier SOLiD discounting. To be clear here, I don't think anyone believes you are not recording any revenue on SOLiD across the board. I think I think what we in the investment community are trying to understand, how broadly you are discounting, and how aggressively are you discounting? So we know you are recoding revenues on SOLiDs, we are trying to get at some of these finer points. Can you help us understand that a little bit better?I can help you understand I think the sales profit. I mean, clearly if someone places an order for multiple units, where you're going to help from those project costs. I think what typically is happening and people get more concerned about, is we will get request to run samples or demonstrations and what we find the most effective way is, if customers see an instrument coming from the lab, get up and going up, they place a purchase order with it. So it's more, I think that the dynamic high, we hear a lot of comments in the marketplace about exactly what's happening. We see great traction from customers getting in. What we are very good at doing is making our customers successful through the field applications support we have and service network, we certainly see that we are going to be competitive as we go into the market. That's where we are and you should know very clearly it's not about us trying to win on price, as I quoted the example of the genome research, we think what we win on is the throughput and accuracy and that trade and translates into a cost of sequencing project. Both on the throughput how many gigabytes as you're getting to run and the accuracy translates into how many runs, how many funds you need to run that sample. So, the example I quoted from genome research and there are other examples coming, that translates into a cost of the run which when most of these customers do the math, they saw the upfront capital which what's going to be the cost of doing this large scale project that is going to translate into a difference there.Okay. And last quarter you said that you received orders for I think you said at least 100 SOLiDs, and I'll be glad if you would be willing to update that year which I'm guessing is probably not going to be the case. And if that is indeed, how you want to approach to this question, could you tell us when we should expect another update?Yes. We're not going to update on the numbers. We passed the milestone and we updated it on the milestone. And we're really focused on giving you a lot of color around the category, we report out these categories. But it's a very competitive market, so we'd rather not give more color than we need to. And just be rest assured we're absolutely committed to winning in this marketplace, you will see us increasingly placing orders around, to more announce and you'll see comments out from customers and the success by getting with these systems and product. So I think those the kind of metrics you should see as we continue to get traction in this marketplace.I would... this is Tony, I'd just encourage you guys to look at our total category. We do tell you what we are doing in DNA sequencing and I think that's a better indicator of our approach to these business and the competitors I mean. You're doing a body count between us and alumina on, I think we've got how many replacement this month, it lowers the fact that we have another very large, very profitable CE business that they don't have. And so we have... we manage our business as a total DNA sequencing business and that's the way you should measure.Okay. That's the fair point Tony. It may be kind of taking out of step further than any chance you would be willing that help us to least understand and what percentage of the CE revenue in the quarter was traditional versus applied market applications?CE breakdown between traditional and applied, yes we don't kind of bake into that anyway but... the short answer is probably no, but I'm trying to think through what that is.Yes, we did as a category, I think what we've said in the past, it's kind of self-accounting, we use the metrics that the genome centers with less than 10% of our business. It's very much less it's not a meaningful. Basically what we are guiding you more is just the continued expansion of markets around the world. We give forensic as an example, but there are many other applied and commercial examples. One is the pharmaceutical industry that's buying in the QC area, the microchip system, which is sequencing data identification. That's also expanding into applications, we're seeing outside of pharma, there's lot of applications in micro identification. You are seeing this translational clinical environment and that segment is growing. So increasingly coming, I think we've said sort of an excess of 50%, 55% of our business is outside what you might consider the core research or smaller core labs in the research segment. And that's just because of the gold standard, it's very easy to work, very easy to use, it's validated. And we're considering to invest in R&D, also into the areas we see more applications that will run in those kind of platforms in the future.All right. Thank you for that. And one last question, any chance you could just provide a little more color as to what's happening in Japan?Yes, Japan's always a fairly okay society to provide color. And certainly our view what we saw this last quarter was a little surprising to us, but we certainly saw some droughts that we were expecting to come into Q1, delay into at current quarter, this second quarter ending December. We've been pleased with some of the traction we've had as we've realigned Japan organization more on consumables and we went to excelling Ambion, so that's made traction. Of course, we have seen what we saw last year, which is some of the Japanese pharma be moving that business out of Japan, into the CROs in China are just generally weak. But those are some of the trends that we've seen. We don't expect the performance of what we saw this quarter to be typical of quarters as we look forward in the business in Japan and we expect growth.Great. Thank you very much.Our next question will come from the line of Peter Lawson of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.Mark beyond the flu, what else in the diagnostic pipeline?Well, Peter I am not going to launch all the diagnostic kit today. But what we saw was a milestone on a journey kit. Journey started clearly as we separated out from Lara, and then continued with getting a single full factory out like 1345 which allows us to meet standards with the IBD. What it also allow us to do in the case of what we did with the CDC was partner with content from our customers. And so, the CDC had a penal of assays that they want to partnering with. And we also work very closely with the FDA with a joint project between the three organizations. And so you will see more of us continuing to get systems that operate more partnering with content providers, and the targeting area is that we think there's real value to enabling our customers to take what we overly live in promise like I mentioned [ph] into these areas. So that's what you're going to expect to see. We currently get a substantial portion of our business in this clinical research environment which is kits and components that we sell into the clear labs that they use it in that framework. And we'll continue to upgrade our quality systems to support those customers.And just switching on to real time PCR, the growth there, how sustainable is that and what's going to affect... how is the competition going to affect that in the next two or three years?Well, the growth is very sustainable, what we've been trying to indicate to you people is much more than just a real time instrumental category but is a broad portfolio of applications that is driving that growth. So as we look forward to continuing to introduce and you have seen some of the applications from microRNAs and you sample prep, and yesterday, you saw from [indiscernible] and the team introduced the OpenArray in collaboration with BioTrove, those are some of the drivers as we enter into fast growing applications in new market areas, and we continue that growth will be considerable in that category.And then finally on Japan, how quickly do you think you can turn around that weakness?It's really a question of the funding coming through in Japan. So we don't expect that, we believe we're well positioned from our organization, but we don't expect the funding to dramatically change. It was a slightly seasonal issue this last quarter relative to what we would expect this current quarter.Okay, thank you so much.Our final question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin of UBS, please proceed.Good morning.I wondered where you were?Yes, no I'm here, I'm here, you're not done with me yet Tony. So it sounds like, it sounds like, we haven't really touched on some of the market stuff. So let me do that. So some of your competitors have mentioned that their potentials of the year end budget flush, companies may not be as healthy as it one... as it was in prior years? Do you have any opinions on that?Yes I don't think we're expecting that the pharma based on what they've said today, in days that we've seen, I know there's a Merck announcement this morning, are suddenly going to become flushed at their calendar end. And so I think with regard to pharma, we are not expecting that change. We do expect as we go into the new calendar year which would be end of our fiscal year. Certainly for mass spectrometry as we both at times and then evaluate new platforms, they'll see the upgrade potential, at the second half of our year, they would see good adoption in that segments. So that's certainly what we expect with regard to mass spec funding which pahrma end market... which should specifically impact the mass spec.And I would add to that. My sense in watching this cycle over the last 15 years is that even in a down market for pharma, if you have a new product introduction, that has compelling advantages in terms of their cost and quality, to getting the clinical work done, and they will find the money, because its cost analysis on the total project and sometimes the cost of the upgrade is just that even in a tight capital market. Now I don't know that that's going to be the case here. I hope it is, it's too soon to tell but certainly there are indicators from our experience, that-that something that we're going to watch for is very well happened because there are some compelling advantages to this technology that may make the pharma companies to believe that they have to upgrade to be competitive.Okay. What if... and I'm going to turn that question now the academic labs. Are you hearing anything about people being concerned about, considering we've got the election coming up, budgets being pushed out, with the endowments potentially be under pressure, what's your feel from the academic front?Well the academic has continued just the same. We've seen no change in the academic and where there's no other area research, where the good researchers they are getting funding, so we continue to see that, which then, we feel bodes well for next generation sequencing, within an academic lab last week in Florida we were discussing the OpenArray and great studies that they're going to take into genetic analysis. And again in the mass spec areas we look at protein biomarker validation. That's an area of tremendous study at the moment. So all of that seems good and no change.And quick into the BioTrove products, can you just elaborate on what you see in the market there and I guess how you intend to roll that out?I'll let Peter Dansky take that for you.Yes hi thanks. we're really excited about the launch and I think as we've talked a little bit in the past, which just allows us to get into some studies and types of opportunities where we couldn't participate before, particularly validation studies and screening studies where the number of snip markers are fairly high, 10s to 100s but the sample throughput is just phenomenally large sometimes in the 1000 or even 10s of 1000. Mark mentioned some of the studies in the script, one particularly area that we see a lot of opportunity is in the agricultural sector, in the crop selection and in breeding, because the sample volume is so high. So we see it as a new market segment and the technology will enable new studies that which really can't be done today.Okay and the financial questions, ABI effectively has had hedges stuff like exposure. It's like how do the recent mood swings in the dollar potentially impacts you, Dennis, can you give us any color on how you see the currencies laying out?Well the dollar has strengthened versus when we released the year end earnings, there is no doubt about it, against the number of major currencies. And that has a negative impact on us on the revenue line and profit line. So we are getting lesser benefit from currency issue that we did last year.Right. Okay I just wanted to say thanks for the memories guys, Tony, Dennis and Peter it's been a interesting year and it's been a pleasure working with you. Thanks.Enjoyed as we've been doing [ph].Dennis, I have been... Derik, you've been very fair and have been rigorous in your work and I really admire that, you did a good job.Thanks.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question and answer portion of today's conference. I will turn the call back to management for closing remarks.This is Peter Dworkin. Thank you for participating in the call today, as we've heard as historic quality to today's call, because we do expect it the last one before the merger with Invitrogen is completed. And as we stated earlier today, our current expectation is that the merger would be completed in mid-November, following the shareholder approval, and the remaining regulatory approval in the EU. We will be posting a management's remarks within the hour on our website and the audio replay will be available later today using the phone numbers listed in today's press releases. Thanks for joining us today.Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. .\",\n",

       "  '2008-07-28 04:06:31'): \"Good morning. My name is Eric, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Applied Biosystems' fourth quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Following the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to introduce Mr. Peter Dworkin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Applied Biosystems. Mr. Dworkin, you may begin your conference call. Please proceed.Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining Applied Biosystems management today to discuss the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2008 financial results that we issued earlier this morning. Present with us today from Applied Biosystems are Tony White, Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Winger, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Stevenson, President and Chief Operating Officer of Applied Biosystems Group. Also here today are other senior managers and Bill Craumer, Investor Relations Director. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about Applied Biosystems' business. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our business that are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in our filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release and on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of the Applied Biosystems website, which is at www.appliedbiosystems.com. On June 11, 2008, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Invitrogen Corporation pursuant to which Invitrogen will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Applied Biosystems stock. In connection with the proposed merger, Invitrogen will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC that will include a joint proxy statement of Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen. Invitrogen said this morning that it expects to file the registration statement by the end of July or early August. Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen will mail the joint proxy statement to their respective stockholders after it is declared effective by the SEC. You are urged to read the joint proxy statement when it becomes available because it will contain important information. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tony White.Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This was a solid quarter for Applied Biosystems, with good growth in consumables and services and actually terrific growth in our Asia Pacific region, which in our management structure excludes Japan. In this area, revenue increased 42% over the prior year quarter. These particular results reflect the investments that we have been making in those areas of our business. Instrument revenues were also up compared to the prior year. We delivered a nice percentage increase in other revenue, up 13% compared to the prior year quarter. If you've read our earnings release, you may have observed for that for the first time, we've given a little more detail to the composition of our other revenue portfolio, as investors have recently asked about this. The other revenue category is primarily our service business and income from our patent estate. In the release, we disclosed that $24.5 million, or 4% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter came from patent royalties and license fees, and within this other revenue category, service revenues are more than three times the royalty and license revenues. For fiscal 2008, the royalty and license income was 4.5% of total revenue. During the quarter, we continued to control expenses, and earnings per share performance sustained the trend established throughout the fiscal year, with double-digit growth. On July 1, we completed the separation of Celera business from Applera. Celera is now an independent company. Applied Biosystems and Celera will do business together following principles that they've agreed to as part of the separation process. With the separation, Applera no longer operates under its former tracking stock structure, and we have changed the name of the remaining company to Applied Biosystems, Inc. I will now turn the call over to Mark Stevenson to talk about the quarter.Thanks, Tony, and good morning to those of you on the call. First, I'd like to comment that planning activities looking ahead to the integration of Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen are progressing very well, with multiple teams working towards a smooth start on day one of the new company. I'm going to now turn to start my comments on the quarter with a high-level commentary about each of our specific product lines and platforms. Today, I'll focus particularly on SOLiD and, given that it's the end of our fiscal year, provide significantly more color than usual about its success and traction in the marketplace. Last quarter we said that given continued development of our SOLiD platform, we expected to see our DNA sequencing segment resume its role as a contributor to Applied Biosystems growth. With that framework, let me confirm that the SOLiD development and commercial teams have executed on this plan and as a result, our DNA sequencing business enjoyed nearly 10% growth in the fourth quarter. In the beginning of May, we started shipping SOLiD 2.0, a major upgrade to our initial platform and one that offers the highest throughput, accuracy and scalability of any next-generation system and platform that's available today. The accuracy and throughput have been demonstrated in the marketplace by customers, the only testing ground that really matters. With the throughput specification of SOLiD 2.0, we have a 6 gigabases of what we call mappable DNA data per run, some customers have reported nearly 15 gigabases of throughput and internally, we have generated runs exceeding 20 gigabases, underscoring the scalability of our platform. In addition, we have now upgraded all previous installations to SOLiD 2.0 capability. SOLiD system sales and installations have been distributed broadly across the globe and across a range of facility sizes. We have secured nearly 100 orders to date, and about 75% of them are outside the major genome centers, meaning at core sequencing facilities at universities, specialized institutes such as cancer research centers, and commercial service labs. With the introduction and market acceptance of SOLiD 2.0, we believe that we are now winning about 40% of new orders for next-gen sequencing and over 50% in some geographies. In addition to throughput and accuracy, we believe that the SOLiD systems yield industry-leading performance in key application areas that we expect to grow strongly in upcoming years. One such area is the study of cancer, probably the single most complex disease and the subject of extensive public and private funding to understand the genetic basis of its cause and development. The SOLiD platform offers superior capability for what is called mate-pair analysis. In a nutshell, our mate-pair analysis enables investigators to detect and accurately map the complete spectrum of genetic variation in the genome. And this not just single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, but also insertions, deletions, long repeat sequences and other chromosomal abnormalities that are so characteristic of cancer. Our system can map repeat sequences up to 12,000 bases long, up to five times longer than competing systems, which is critical for accurate sequence assembly. Applied Biosystems is collaborating closely with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and other leading researchers and institutions to gain a more complete understanding of cancer and the cancer genome. In time, this should enable development of new cancer diagnostics and more effective therapeutic approaches. The power of the SOLiD platform as a breakthrough discovery tool has also been demonstrated in applications aimed at understanding gene expression patterns. When the human genome project was completed in around 2000, most scientists believed that just 30,000 genes or so, a very small fraction of the human genome, was actually transcribed into RNA and then translated into amino acids and proteins. The rest of the genome was considered junk DNA. Just eight years later, life science researchers now believe that between 80% and 90% of the genome is transcribed into some sort of RNA, including a range of small and micro RNAs, many of which play important regulatory roles that determine which genes are turned on and off in different cells and disease states. Unlike microarray-based approaches to gene expression analysis, the SOLiD platform enables researchers to look very broadly at the totality of RNA transcripts, known as the transcriptome. One of our customers recently published a paper describing how his research team used the SOLiD system to develop and perform sequencing-based transcriptome profiling. This type of technique will help researchers identify distinguishing features in the genetic makeup of cells and better understand, for example, how breakdowns in the molecular pathways can lead to complex diseases. This was one of three papers published during the fourth quarter based on data generated on the SOLiD system. We expect to see many more publications going forward. We are gearing up for SOLiD growth in fiscal 2009 and beyond and we have ramped production capacity. We now have the ability to assemble and ship systems on an unconstrained basis to meet demand. In addition to new SOLiD-optimized sample preparation and labeling products, we plan to introduce during fiscal 2009 automation tools and other innovations to further improve SOLiD workflows and ease of use. We plan to sustain and build on our 40% win rate going forward. Turning to the performance of our CE systems and consumables, in Q4 it was consistent with our expectations. Sequencing consumables revenue increased over the prior year, indicating that the use of our global installed base of CE systems continues to increase. And while the revenues from selling high-throughput CE systems declined due to the shift in the high-end market to next-generation sequencing, we sold more low-to-medium throughput instruments than in the prior year quarter. We believe this was due to the fact that CE technology continues to be the gold standard in commercial applications such as molecular testing and diagnostics, and forensics. Trends in these commercial applications for CE sequencing continue to be positive. For example, the U.S. House of Representatives this month voted to reauthorize and increase funding of the Debbie Smith Act, which funds forensic sequencing by law enforcement agencies. Additionally, the U.S. government is drafting policies for taking DNA samples from suspects arrested for federal crimes, as well as from illegal immigrants detained at the U.S. borders. The FBI estimates that the new immigrant program will add 1 million new samples annually to the U.S. criminal DNA database, which currently has DNA profiles on file. We are extremely pleased with the 15% growth in the fourth quarter in the real-time PCR and applied genomics product category. At 36% of revenue, this is the largest part of our portfolio, as well as the fastest growing. Included in this category are PCR-based research consumables such as our TaqMan assays, our Ambion products, and our consumables kits for DNA forensics, all of which generated very strong double-digit growth. We are also encouraged by further sales gains of our MicroSeq kit for identifying bacterial and fungal contaminants in the manufacturing of biologics, drugs and vaccines. The revenues from these kits, which run on our CE sequencing machines, are also included in the real-time PCR and applied genomics category. We believe pharmaceutical manufacturing is an attractive area for growth and have a number of new products for this market in development. The mass spectrometry product revenue category increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year. From a global segment standpoint, applied markets were strongest at double-digit growth, reflecting demand for applications such as safety monitoring of water and food. Our small molecule business grew modestly, and our proteomics business declined. As in the third fiscal quarter, cautious spending by pharma, which is not being offset entirely by strength among the CROs, and competitive offerings in proteomics were the main drivers in these segments. Geographically, results mirrored growth in key applications. We saw excellent growth in Asia, particularly in China where all three segments grew, and for the first time in a while, we had modest triple quad and QTrap growth in Japan. Sales were solid in North America, led by strength in applied markets, while pharma weakness hurt mass spec results in Europe. From a product standpoint, Q4 saw continued strength in our QTraps and triple quad systems, which are predominantly used in pharmaceutical, applied market, and quantitative proteomic applications, and continued weakness in our accurate mass products used primarily in proteomics research. Mass spec is a capital equipment business, which therefore tends to be lumpy and driven by the introduction of new products. We plan to introduce new hardware before the end of the calendar year and throughout the next fiscal year to reinforce some of the software and workflow improvements that we launched in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal year 2008. I would like to summarize at a high level how we see the AB business performing over the next 12 months to supplement the fiscal 2009 outlook in today's earnings release. As in that outlook, the following statements assume current currency rates applied throughout the next 12 months, in other words, they include an expected benefit from currency. In DNA sequencing, we expect a single-digit decline in the CE sequencing offset by significant growth from SOLiD. We expect our growth from SOLiD to come from continued growth in the market for next-generation sequencing, as well as further gains in our market share. In total, we expect modest growth in DNA sequencing revenues. We expect the share gains in next-generation sequencing will come from a host of factors, including the positive momentum from the 2.0 launch, customer references, more publications, new workflows for small RNA analysis and gene expression analysis, further system improvements, especially for sample preparation, and the reach and customer relationship of our global sales, marketing and field support organization. We expect our diversified and dynamic real-time PCR and applied genomics product revenue category to continue to grow at approximately a double-digit rate, moderated in part by a decline in licensing fees. And we expect mass spec performance to improve with the introduction of new systems. Our two other product revenue categories, core PCR and DNA synthesis and other product lines, are mature businesses that generate healthy cash flow and support our growth businesses. In fiscal 2009, revenue from royalties and licenses on our patent portfolio is expected to decline somewhat because we expect less income from granting new licenses than we had last year. The amount of royalty revenue should be similar to last year. Now Dennis Winger will review our Q4 financial performance and discuss our fiscal 2009 outlook in more detail.Thank you, Mark. As mentioned, our fourth quarter results were highlighted by solid revenue growth and continued strong EPS growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was 29% higher than the prior year quarter. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was 56.5% compared to 55.4% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by a favorable impact of foreign currency and lower enzyme costs partially offset by mass spectrometry pricing. During the fourth quarter, SG&A expenditures increased 10% from the prior year level primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency, as well as employee-related costs and regional investments in China and other fast-growing markets. R&D expenditures decreased 2% in the fourth quarter from the prior year period principally due to lower employee-related costs and the termination in June 2007 of a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Partially offsetting the decrease were investments in programs related to the SOLiD system. Fourth quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per share from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis was $0.49, an increase of approximately 29% compared to $0.38 in the prior year period. Excluding foreign currency, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 13% over prior year. The accelerated stock repurchase program transaction was accretive to Applied Biosystems' fiscal 2008 earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. We did not make any open-market purchases of Applied Biosystems shares during the fourth quarter or since in the view of our proposed combination with Invitrogen. In the past five years, the company has repurchased $1.7 billion of Applied Biosystems stock. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release, as well as on the Financial Reports page of our Investor website, www.appliedbiosystems.com. Cash flow from continuing operations during the fourth quarter was strong at $163.6 million, capital expenditures were $18.2 million. At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $475.6 million, representing 58 days sales outstanding, and inventory was $161.8 million, representing 3.3 months of inventory on hand. At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term investments were $543.2 million, up from $449.5 million as of June 30th, 2007. The increase was largely the result of cash flow from operations partially offset by the $162 [ph] million payment to Morgan Stanley for our accelerated stock repurchase transaction, a portion of which was funded with available cash and the balance of which was funded by $275 million in short-term debt. We repaid $175 million of these borrowings by the end of the fourth quarter and an additional $50 million since then, leaving $50 million in debt outstanding as of today. Regarding Applied Biosystems expectations in its financial performance for 2009, I would refer you to today's earnings release. As noted, while the combination with Invitrogen is targeted to close during the fall of 2008, this outlook is provided as if we had not entered into a merger agreement with Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems remains an independent entity during all of fiscal 2009. This is in order for us to give our investors look at our expectations. At current currency rates, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth, with revenues above the prior year level for both instruments and for consumables. We also anticipate growth in the DNA sequencing, real-time PCR/applied genomics, and mass spectrometry product categories and declines in core PCR and other product lines. We anticipate modest gross margin and operating margin improvements in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Finally, we expect non-GAAP EPS to increase faster than revenues. On a stand-alone basis, capital spending would be at an expected $60 million to $80 million. We'll now be able to take your questions on Applied Biosystems. Question and Answer[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Hi. Good morning. A quick question I guess maybe starting out with the mass spec business, I just wanted to get a little bit more color, I appreciate the growth you've seen in that segment this quarter, but with MDS doing some restructuring, I'm wondering if you can comment on the impact that may have to your business there? And then also your comment around pricing, has it materially gotten worse over the quarter in the mass spec business? Thanks.Yes, Tycho, I can take that question. So, yes, MDS did announce some changes with the analytical technology. The goal of that that was not to affect product development activities nor innovation rather they were focused on the size and sort of restructure from their organization for high productivity and to help accelerate new products into the growing market. So, we work very closely with MDS on a day-to-day basis. We don't expect any impact on that with a lot of new products. So, that's the sort of answer to first part of your question. As regard to the second, it continues to be in an increasingly competitive market, it always has and we continue to say that. Having said that, we continue to compete well into the market that demonstrates, if you have the performance features, if you have the right applications reach the market, that you can maintain the prices. So, that's where we are focus on our product offerings and the innovation and we'll continue to do that.Okay. And then with regards to your comments, Mark, on SOLiD. Can you just talk a little bit about where your customers are in terms of consumable pull-through at this point? And then, you said about 75% outside the major genome centers and then you highlighted, I guess, cancer research in some of the commercial service labs. Can you just give us a sense as to how it breaks out in terms of early demand outside the big genome centers?Well, firstly on consumables, our guidance continues to be that we expect the consumables throughput and run rate to be in the order of about $175,000, that kind of range. And... or we should take the royalty to customers together, up going and sort up and running, but that time is also coming down. I commented at the previous calls where generally we estimated about a quarter, current validation times to get systems in and down to about 60 days and improving. We have been streamlining the acceptance testing protocol and we're expecting to get revenue recognition down to about 30 days, following shipment, which has increased that consumable pull-through. With regard to the second segment, it's hard to break out further than we did. We wanted to give you color that this is a broadly diversified market, with my statement of the proportion outsize of the genome centers. We've particularly focused on whether those applications are drawing in new funding and that's why we particularly identified cancer, being a genetic disease, being just a complexity of it. We are seeing a lot of new funding coming into institutes to study that, as well as you say these applications, gene expression, where institutes are looking again at all that microarray gene expression-based and saying, well, we may have missed something first time around, so let's run those experiments on the next-generation sequencing and do this all transcript profiling. So, that's what's growing the demand outside the traditional sequencing centers and of course even new applications and market growth.Okay. And then just one last one on real-time PCR in terms of the guidance you laid out. Are you factoring anything in here for BioTrove and some of the new form factors for genotyping, if they come here?Yes, we are. So, the BioTrove collaboration is going well and it's on track. And we'll anticipate introducing products during this fiscal year that would use the BioTrove format. We have just such a great wealth of assays and deploying them in different formats, you would have seen... this quarter we took some of the assays out and put them in more custom formatting and plating, which has helped a lot of our customers and the BioTrove format will allow us to go into this mid-density genotyping space where people have already started some trials through that customers, be it a drug metabolizing enzymes and some of the pharmaceutical customers albeit put that into a BioTrove format.Okay, great. Congratulations on the quarter.Thanks, Tycho.Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Can you help us understand how you arrived at the 40% win rate on the competition for next-generation sequencing businesses? Could you just help us understand what's... I guess what's in the denominator there?It was a fairly simple math equation, which was... we know where the orders are going on during the last quarter. We are involved in overlap, we counted up the number of units we won. And counted up the numbers we lost to our competitors. So, it wasn't too complicated an analysis that we did. These units don't go on without as knowing about them in the market. We have a great level of reach into overlap and really the impact of 2.0. When we introduced that into the market, it generated a huge amount of buzz at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting. We just saw continued traction going up in the market going forward and that's what we saw in Q4 and so it would be nice to give a win rate out there to people to date where we are, clearly we've been very aggressive to make sure that our customers are fully supported in going through and have been very successful with the results there.And we appreciate you sharing the metric, and we too have heard more encouraging feedbacks sent to you rolled out the upgrade. I guess I just want to make sure you're winning 40% of the business you're going after, that's not necessarily an overall... an estimate of what's going on in general in the market?We think we know pretty well what's going on in the market. It's a time based, what happened last quarter... I mean the snapshot I mean clearly a year ago, we weren't even in the market, comparing a year ago to a year ago, just looking at what happened and it's looking at how many units got placed and how many units we placed and those are orders. So, that's how we did the calculation.Okay. And maybe one follow-up on SOLiD, there's been a lot of talk in the investment community, I think maybe more so in the investment community and the scientific community about ABI heavily discounting SOLiDs to get out there, to get them out into the market. Could you maybe address this directly and just, I guess, either confirm or deny that this is occurring and talk about how this has evolved since the upgrade?Yes, the major comment that I back and I agree with you, it's in the investment community, perhaps you're going to ask the customers and that's not what's happening, but the comment I back is that we are replacing systems for free and that's a false statement. What we have done is we placed a number of systems on consignment with the customers as part of collaborations that we directed it in publications and message development. Those customers pay for those units or will pay from back. This is normal practice when we take an industry and use any kind of disruptive technology as part of getting acceptance, or there has been contracts and deals associated with all that. And that's been a very minor part and in some of the area once we did, they have all translated into orders that we've had. So, that's a normal thing we've done and hundreds orders that we quote are real orders out there. They are not part of that placement, we would...And that's very consistent with their bill practice, any new instruments that we launch. So, we frequently do that, we're expecting to develop applications, we then take other customers with old products that we saw in the application.That is tremendously helpful. On the deal, I think it's fair to assert that a merger such as that which is proposed between you and Invitrogen can't help, but at least be a little bit disruptive. And I know that's a bit leading, but I'm hoping that you might be able to talk a little bit about where maybe specific areas within your business where you're maybe more or less concerned about the potential for distractions and maybe share with us how the potential for those distractions are factored into your guidance?Well, firstly your assertion is a correct one. I mean any large merger has the potential for disruption. And so we've gone into this with a very thoughtful process. We've worked closely with our colleagues at Invitrogen to think about how we want to view the timing. We've engaged with an outside body to like... to help sort of things bring best practice today and instead of a very formalized integration process. We targeted really the areas where we see opportunities for synergy and overlap. I mean we were just talking about SOLiD, I mean SOLiD is one of those areas where continued focus, continued business as normal. That's not an area where we're looking at potential overlaps, but where we see those overlaps, we put dedicated people on them and not there distracted in the day-to-day business and we are being thoughtful about it and making sure that as we come forward to a day one and potential... I mean together those two companies there, it's a trouble-free event. The integration also it will then continue over several years is when it will be completed on day one. So, we are being very thoughtful in that and careful to cause just the minimum disruption that we can. At the same time, we are making sure we can look for the synergies as we've outlined when the new companies looking at this combination. There are considerable synergies to be had, the integration team and the missions we set for these people were set aside for these integration planning is to go validate that and make sure that those synergies can be found and realized.That's helpful, and one last question, I'll get back in the queue. At least a couple of your competitors either today or over the last few days have talked about how they anticipate passing along the impact of some higher raw material customers' cost to their customers in the form of prices increases. I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but to the extent you haven't talked about that already. Can you just maybe pass along some thoughts about how you're planning the approach, any pressures you may be facing from higher raw material costs? Thank you.Yes. We are certainly looking at those as well, particularly in the cost of freight which is increasingly a business moving from a more consumable business, there's a lot of shipments each day. And so that's been a major area of focus around freight. On the other side, I would say as much as we get increase at the moment here we have also done a tremendous job of sourcing that product, procurement group efforts in moving a lot of manufacturing also into Singapore, we are now sourcing areas of Asia where we continue to drive cost out. So, while we've got those two components going on, we are also mitigating that by some of that productivity improvement we have been doing in that manufacturing and supply chain operation.Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a nice end to your fiscal year. As you take a look at the forecast for fiscal 2009, could you tell us a little bit about some of the assumptions you're making for your end markets like big pharma, demand, and academic and biotech in applied markets?Yes. I mean, at big pharma we've still found constrain in some of its spending. We are optimistic that at sometime we've seen these trends in pharma that we see these cycles come and go. And so, as it comes during the calendar year, I mean for the new calendar year for pharma, we've made a few changes in that, but we've not tremendously placed that into any . Academic funding, similar story. So, the business is usual in the academic funding. It's tremendously focused on going up to those areas where we see what areas of research. It's like, talk a lot about these applications with SOLiD and cancer or gene expression, talk about what we are doing in MicroRNA, because what see is continued funding in the academic area focused on the needs and continues to be progress every time you open the newspaper and read some of the scientific panels and focus on disease some of these... what areas of academic funding is where we are focused on. And on applied markets we continue to expect to be strong. We don't think there is going to be any change from the concern of the world about the quality of that food, the quality of the environment, it's not going away anytime soon and most of the world is waking up for the fact that DNA fingerprinting testing is just a great way to identify criminals more in a proactive way. So, that's all led into our forecast together with the assumption that more biologic drives some more activity, and biotech will continue to focus on biologics and bio-manufacturing.Thank you for that. Very helpful. As for as... earlier today Invitrogen talked about integration teams and... how are you managing the two R&D groups? Because again Invitrogen talked about moving ahead toward what they call third-generation consumable-based next-generation sequencing. And how does that... how can you or can you dovetail any of that work with what you are doing now with some of your internal projects?So, our internal projects are just continuing as normal. So, there is no work we've been doing together on that. Clearly in the integration planning, we look towards the future and really the work... it's setting out what are the priorities. Clearly, if you look towards what we have with SOLiD, actually we believe that SOLiD has always taken it into the sort of second-generation, third-generation sort of throughput we adopted. If you look to the extra capability that we've driven already, we're certainly aware and we currently buy components from Invitrogen that relate to the some of the [inaudible] use in the system. So, there are opportunities as we look towards that, where we say we could look for opportunities and synergy and that maybe specifically new R&D programs that we are considering in the new company.Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Good morning. Thanks a million for taking the call. And congratulations on the ongoing proposed merger with Invitrogen and the results. Can you maybe just add a little bit more detail to a few things here? For example, you said you've had about 100... 100 orders to date in the SOLiD. And can you, Mark, maybe just describe where you are at in terms of revenue recognition from the date of... kind of order shipment to when you're recognizing revenues on these now?Yes, we... I can, Jonathan. So, I'll give you a bit more color on that. I mean certainly the traction we've seen is after introducing 2.0 at the beginning of May, that's where we've certainly seen the pick up coming in our order pipeline and flow. And that's built up a backlog for us, which is good. As I've mentioned, originally we took about 90 days quarter. What we've been doing is, getting more standard and streamlined acceptance protocol. It is bringing down both the validation time for acceptance revenue recognition. We're currently around 60 days and improving, just as we get maturity of the platform and expect to be well under 30 days following shipment as we go forward.So, is it... I mean, is it fair to say from that as a lot of these orders came in May after back of that you... in your backlog that you are... you haven't necessary recognized a lot of the revenues yet from the orders to date?A fair conclusion to draw.Okay. And then as you're... as the size of the markets as you.... I know initially you put up some numbers, but you've been doing this work and talking with customers and seem to grow. Is the size of the next-gen market... the potential size of it changed at all in terms of how big you either think it is or will be over the last, say, three to six months?Yes, I think the number we've earned out are still directionally the right number and the growth that we see. Maybe a little bit more upside that we're seeing on that and it's really a question of the sort of ramp rate that we see and how we go forward on it. But I think directionally those market sizes we believe are still the right market sizes. I think we are doing some more work, sort of update that and probably during August, you will hear us bring out sort of a pressured view of what we think the market is, as we do some more work just to validate again [inaudible] what the size of the market is after that.I mean, this is Tony. I think one of the things that we have to update is our view of the market. As we move from throughput levels, one initially to three to six, I think is what we're specifying now, but we see 15, 20 and more on the horizon. We believe that's going to impact the size of the market, because new applications are going to emerge as a result of that. And so I think that update will have... that data will have to be [inaudible] into an update. It may result meaningful changes to our view of the size of the market.Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot. And then on the flip side of that, you said high throughput instruments and see single digits again. Where do you think you are in terms of the decline? When that kind of flattens out to some degree, if it does? Or if you think that's going to zero. But I know that some of the view has been to that kind of declines or maybe at some point flattens.Well, we still see a residual demand in 3730, which is a high throughput instrument. And actually we've participated in that market also as offering some of the customers refurbished and reconditioned instruments [inaudible]. There are still applications that we think are going to be there. The guidance given to you for 2009 is really discerning. Some people think that our key business is it was going to decline on a [inaudible] two, three years. It's going to decline very quickly over time, here we are entering another fiscal year when that's not been the case if you look at the overall business. We are predicting the decline next year, and that's a single-digit decline that we predicted. At some point, what happens is more of the median throughput instruments over set that high throughput instruments in the consumable growth market. Those are the dynamics going on in that market at the moment.Okay. And then just kind of a few clarification questions and then I'll get off. But on the Real-Time PCR, can you just describe again exactly what you were saying you are expecting in licensing revenue next year? I think you said overall, the same amount but fewer new licenses, is that right? Is that what you were saying?What we've said was we expected royalty in levels to be similar to prior year. But a lower licensing fee; in other words, people taking new licenses will decline and so that's the difference. So it's the difference between licensing fees and the royalties that come after that.Okay. So you said, lower licensing but similar royalties. And then on Mass Spec, any... there has been a lot of discussion both from you and Invitrogen that there are things in the pipe that are going to come out this year. Is that still on track? Anymore specificity around maybe when those will come out?Well, yeah, we'll continue to be very consistent. We won't announce it until we announce it. But I think we've given a lot of color that, I suppose at the end of the calendar year, during this fiscal year, we'll introduce more products and no change to that update.Okay. And then employee turnover in the quarter, can you just talk about that? Was there any increase post kind of the merger announcements?Nothing out of the ordinary.Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate a lot more detail. Very good. Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with UBS. Please proceed.Good morning.Hi, Derik.Missed you on the Celera call last night, Tony.Derik, we didn't.I'm not saying a thing there.I know you're not. I know you're not.So a question. Just I guess, when you look at the interest... and a lot of the stuff I wanted to ask has already been asked. I'm trying to fish around the size here. So when you look at the interest for the SOLiD products, can you possibly tell us what people are looking for in terms of applications? How many of these are more sequence specific, how many of these are... how many of these are more... I guess, people looking for gene expression type applications versus DNA analysis of applications? Give us some breakdown on what the feel for that is?Derik, I was asked the same questions yesterday, I'm not looking forward to the answer.And as I... I keep saying that only and we've tried to... I mean, it is a fast-moving area and field. We... it is a good question, Derik, because we're very focused on applications and workflow. There are sort of a series of applications that we... that are out there and sort of shown in our presentation. Specifically, you can see from my comments earlier that the two that we're really focused on is looking at just this whole structural variation area and taken a particularly focus around the disease of cancer and just because of the complexity of looking at the inserts into this genome, variation in this genome deletion, other structural variations. This one application, it just required the attributes that we have in the system in terms of accuracy and throughput, lend itself very well to doing those studies as well as the systems to make that. So that's one sort of broad set of applications and those customers continuing to demand further improvement in that and we focus on that work flow, you'll see us announce in the software community new tools for that as we try to expand that and make that application easier for those customers to be more robust in just labs around the world. And the second application area we're focused on is this gene expression area, which is a pretty interesting new area that's... and somewhere, we already are the biggest gene expression company with all the work we do with patent and on validating all the work that's been done on array. But now there's a whole new area of work going on where people are going back and looking at really what to express in the genome. And that's often going on in labs where we need to focus more on the workflow, so you'll see us working with the more completions of side in often Ambion to make sure we got an application kit for doing some of these small RNA, making that application more robust and easy to use, and working with the game of software tools necessary to do the kind of work that the group from Australia published on [inaudible] on this being called now transcript-owned profiling. So those are the two applications. Tony used it as a follow-up question to me, okay, Mark, we'll help dig out of those and what's the size of that market and it's very dynamic, we're judging it from sort of where the directionally the applications are, but that's where we've got our focus on, the R&D applications and those are the two that we are focused around.Great. Dennis, I wanted to ask a question just on the gross margin line, I mean your guidance calls for a slightly higher gross margin in fiscal '09. But in 2Q... fiscal 2Q of last year, 58.1% of some royalties in that. To get to the higher number there, are you kind of implying a much... [inaudible] that kind of implies a much significant ramp up in the gross margin. We agree that you didn't see that in the last two quarters. What's kind of built into that, the expectation of the gross margin trending higher?A couple of things, mostly operational efficiencies and improved margins on our Enzymes program are probably the two largest factors.Okay. And kind of I will get back in the queue, thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with First Analysis. Please proceed.Good morning. I could use a little more detail on the forecast for the first quarter. If you are looking at... I mean from current exchange rates, I would expect foreign currency to be a bigger benefit in the first quarter of fiscal '09 than it was in fiscal '08 which would imply that you're looking for organic growth to be lower in fiscal '09 versus fiscal '08 and that comes despite the positive feedback and order flow you're getting on the new product launch of SOLiD 2.0. So could you help me understand what are some of the other dynamics in play there?Well, the fact is on the positive side are the right ones and we were trying to give a call out to what we think Q1 looks like to guide you in the right direction. Some of the numbers we've got from Street look like they didn't take into account the... traditionally, this is our weaker quarter for as you see to see on the sort of breakdown in the four quarters, because of the instrument seasonality we have, for example, in Europe and so that's factored in. As well when you look to the full year, it comes a little bit through the introduction of new products later in the calendar here in the mass spectrometry side. As I commented with capital instruments cycle, typically when you are introducing your product during the fiscal year, that drives new growth. So those are the considerations we've got as we made our fiscal plan and sort of estimate for the first quarter.Okay. And then Mark, even on the capital equipment side, if you have 100 orders in hand at, let's say, $500,000 an order, that's $50 million today and I would presume that you would take more orders throughout the course of fiscal 2009. So with only a single-digit decline in the CE business, it seems like the DNA sequencing business could have quite strong growth, which should growth which should drive the overall top line. Am I thinking about that correctly or am I missing a piece?Well, those are the pieces in the model you want to think about. I mean where... we are not going to break out anymore detail, but those are the drivers and mitigators of that revenue category. You have to bear in mind, we have a big fee business at the moment and so that's a fairly large number when you get that decline going down. And your estimate on the solid update and it will go on, and the update goes on throughout the year. So that's the way that you should think about the model for that category. And that's the plan we will have to execute here.What's the typical lag between receiving an order and shipping the product for SOLiD?Typically, I mean as in most capital instrument cycles, we're normally in a sort of six to eight-week timeframe, that's typically where we do and try to get to most of our instrument cycles. Oftentimes, we try to ship, if possible, to most of the customer labs not ready for it, sort of can go up and down such as yet, and to get ordered towards the end of the quarter, because you sometimes build out backlog [inaudible] nature of the business.Yeah. And my final question for Dennis. Dennis, also in the forecast, you're expecting SG&A as a percentage of revenue to increase in fiscal '09. Why is that?Largely increased investment in the agent-specific area and other emerging markets, and some of it's currency. Not half of it is currency.Okay. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of John Sullivan with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.Hey guys, good morning. Congratulations. A couple of quick ones. First one, in the Real-Time PCR Applied Genomics category, can you talk about the drivers away from TaqMan? And just for a second, for example, I'm wondering if RNA gets the old Ambion lines, is that a significant grower, is it a grower near the... anywhere near the 15% experience of the entire category?Yes, the Ambion business continues to be a strong double-digit grower for us, including those debt.Okay. And then secondly, also in that category, are you seeing any meaningful business away from life science labs? Specifically, are you seeing any meaningful business in hospital labs or clinical labs for the products of Real-Time PCR Applied Genomics?Yes, we are. I mean we continue to see this trend where now you see movement of discovery, the validation on TaqMan and then being used in extensive clinical research in clinics and institutes. So, that's something we have done. We've continued and actually have accelerated some of our programs to ensure that, we upgrade our quality systems to support our customers in those clinics and the components. We've also been working in, for example, some of our factories like our Singapore operations was recently given ISO 1345 certification, which allows us to register products and go forward with, for example, in Europe, register in the key IVD market. So, we see that move into those kind of clinical labs. We also see the pharma move it into the clinic with some of the TaqMan assays, which are used in drug metabolizing enzymes and sort of is that trend. And then the two other markets, which are increasingly validated for us, one is this pharma biologics, which is definitely a validated controlled market and we see update of TaqMan products into that. And finally, our business with Ambion, it started which was in the animal health area, which is also validated and regulated market, and so we are working with the regulators there to register us. I can ask them to launch more products for the animal health market.Thanks very much for all of that.Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.What's been driving the tax rate lower or rather for 2009 what has given you that lower tax rate and is that transferable do you think for Invitrogen?I don't know Invitrogen's tax position, I am not going to comment on Invitrogen's tax rate. So, what's driving it for us is greater use of our Singapore facility and a restructuring of our relationship with Singapore is the primary factor driving the lower taxes.Okay. And then on the R&D side, there was a lower R&D expense that was coming from lower employee-related costs. What was that and is that going to continue going forward?Yes, the main impact as we've broken out most of this year is actually being a reorganization in R&D related to the termination we did at the U.S. Air Force contract, so we've stopped that project. As we look towards sort of the right level of R&D, we've continued to stay, the sort of current level that we have is approximately the right level for R&D spending.It will be slightly lower, which is 8.8% slightly.And we do a very active sort of portfolio of those R&D projects to make sure that investments are aligned with some of the areas you're going to talk about, so that we've increased that, I would say, output of the new products during this last 12 months and what we've launched in the marketplace from SOLiD to consumables through other products in the applied markets, even as we brought down our R&D spending, so we've actually got better productivity out of the group by really taking about a portfolio of products aligning investments with our strategy.Most of that just carry over from these actual numbers.Okay. And then, is there anything emerging out of the DNA synthesis business, that's just been accelerating over the last four quarters?Yes, I think that DNA synthesis category actually improved PCR thermal cycle, a very mature business and really a lot of these specialties about the year and talking about expiration of PCR patents. And actually we introduced a new thermal cycle this last year in the Verity, which has done very well for us. It continues to amaze me personally, the number of thermal cycles we sell each quarter, but it's a very successful quarter and that's called some of the growth DNA through the actual... other technology in that categories continue to decline.Okay. Thank you so much.Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.Thanks for taking the follow-ups. Real-time PCR, sales were up a bit lower than Street expectations last quarter, they rebounded nicely this quarter. How much of the sequential growth... I am sorry, how much of the year-over-year growth would you attribute to sequential normalization?I don't know what that means though.I guess it means that last quarter you came in a little bit light of Street expectations. You put up a good quarter this quarter. How much of that is just good year-over-year growth versus maybe timing where maybe some orders didn't come in last quarter and --.You know these differences that you guys count to spend on so much are really pretty small differences. A point or so of growth here is not terribly meaningful. I will say that we've had a couple of woodshed sessions here about momentum in this area and there have been some new marketing and sales programs implemented new vigor around this in the field. Peter Dansky is smiling at me here, but he has just gotten back from the woodshed, I think.But they are getting, they're just getting, there is new vigor and new attraction in this area. So, I think you could attribute some of it to that and some of it could just.. it's just the way the timing of the quarters work, I don't Mark, you want to add to that?I just don't think it's as dramatic. I think that's the main discussion we've had and let's accelerate it. Occasionally, [inaudible] excuses and don't even let me do that and say at least it was a different time this year than it was the prior year.It is every year, Mark.So, we said that... if you take the six months, the Easter of the following year before was it decreased the different times or it increased following Q3. So, some of it's just the timing, why the counter moved around, but I will say that we have had a lot of discussions here at planning and I think the team has really recommitted themselves to reinvigorating their momentum in this business and it's obviously paying off. We've got... we've got a couple of really exciting new products in this area that I think got off to a less than stellar start relative to their capabilities, the StepOne product line is an extremely attractive product line and I think it's not unfair to say we didn't really give it our best effort initially and now I think it started to get traction. And the way we are pumping new products into the application-specific consumable side of this business is pretty impressive. So, I'm pretty encouraged by that whole business.But the good news, Mark, is that Christmas is predictable.That is helpful. Can you on the pace of SOLiD order placements or I guess I should say just orders. Can you give us any color on how many orders or what percentage of orders came in plus the 2.0?There was a clear acceleration in ramp. I don't have in front of me all the details, sort of when it was and it excludes some of the 100 orders we had already and some that we have recognized, the mix of things.We are actually holding back, not taken orders and so we've got to those, a lot of people --We were all right. I deliberately used the term unconstrained shipments now, because we constrained shipments in the January time. We shipped with installed base system because we hadn't used the upgrade we wanted to do in 2.0 and so we didn't saw shipping those systems through additional customers until we got those systems out there. Because we knew we are going to upgrade all the systems. We've done a tremendous effort of also going round upgrading in the field to 2.0. Customers have really appreciated that as well because we said even if we launch 2.0 the upgradability of the system is there, as we continue to develop the system, there will be continued ramp. So, it was certainly was an inflection point for us. The last two months of the fiscal year and particularly the last couple of weeks were great fun as we closed a lot of orders here and we continued to see strong traction in the marketplace.Okay. So, last one. Recognizing you guys have definitively made a lot of progress with the upgrade. You just pointed to the fact that you were holding back orders until you got the upgrade out there and that makes a lot of sense to me. But I guess one hole that people could poke at, one hole in your 40% of the market capture number could be that there was some pent up demand, you're holding back on orders. How would you answer that?Maybe gone to somebody else while we were holding back. I think the 40% number is real. I think it's... if we don't give you all of the exact numbers and we're not going to, we could have this debate all day, but we're confident that we've given you the right guidance about that.Okay.And that's the matter we said going forward, as well as we look to the year, and that's what you are going to expect our internal and communication experience will be as well.I mean you would agree get that while you're not telling a customer you don't want to accept the order yet, that temptation is going to go elsewhere and they didn't.No that's right. It's... you guys certainly are making progress. I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on that.It appears we have no more audio questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dworkin for closing remarks.Thank you. Well, we've come to the end of our call. Thanks for joining us today. I'd just point out that since obviously there is keen interest in SOLiD that we'll be participating in the first week of August at the Leerink Swann Conference on the panel there about next-generation sequencing technology. Also a reminder that we post the management remarks that you heard this morning, the prepared remarks on our website that should be posted shortly. And that a replay of this conference call will also be available for a couple of weeks always on our website. Information about finding that is provided in our press release this morning. Thanks and have a great morning and day.Thank you for you participation in today's conference. This concludes our presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.\",\n",

       "  '2008-04-30 10:17:23'): \"Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your patience and we definitely apologize for the technical difficulty. Good day, and welcome to the Applera Corporation's Third Quarter Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sylvana and I will pass the call over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Peter Dworkin. You may proceed, sir.Good morning everyone, and let me offer an apology for the conference call service technical problem this morning, but we're glad that you're with us. Thank you for joining Applera management to discuss the third quarter fiscal 2008 financial results that we issued earlier this morning for Applera Corporation and its Applied Biosystems Group and Celera Group. As in previous calls, this morning we will discuss both of our businesses separately starting with Applied Biosystems and then moving on to Celera. The Celera portion of the call will begin at 11:45 Eastern Time. Unless the Applied Biosystems portion should run beyond that time, in which case the Celera portion will follow immediately thereafter. Present today are Tony White, Chief Executive Officer of Applera; Dennis Winger, Chief Financial Officer; Mark Stevenson, President of Applied Biosystems; and Kathy Ordoñez, President of Celera; as well as other executives from the Applera operating businesses. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about Applera's businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure that are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in Applera's filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for both businesses. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with/or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials for each business can be found in today's press release and on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of the Applied Biosystems website which is appliedbiosystems.com and the Celera website at celera.com. Also please note that after this call, the text of these prepared remarks will be posted on the Investor Relations section of the Applera website and on the separate Investor Relations sites of Applied Biosystems and Celera. Now, Tony White and Applied Biosystems President Mark Stevenson will comment on the performance of Applied Biosystems during the quarter. And also on the call today is Bill Craumer, IR Director for Applied Biosystems.Morning everyone. Sorry about the delay. I am not quite sure what happened. Apparently our vendor forgot how to do the one thing they're suppose to know how to do so. Anyway good morning and just to comment, the highlights of Applied Biosystems' performance for the third fiscal quarter were similar to the second quarter's, with good growth in our consumables product lines, which is up 7% year-over-year and is now 42% of revenues on a year-to-date basis, and the transitions and challenges in some of our instrument systems, a category that decreased 1% and now represents 39% of our revenue year-to-date. Also notable was an 8% increase in our other sources of revenue, which are primarily services, support, and royalties. On the expense side we continue to manage costs prudently, in part to free up funds that we are redirecting to support higher growth areas of the business. Careful cost management as well as the weaker U.S. dollar helped the non-GAAP earnings per share increase 22% this quarter. Geographically we saw 24% growth in Asia Pacific, with especially strong results in China, and we also saw good growth in other emerging markets such as Latin America. Elsewhere business conditions have been challenging. Most notably, compared to the prior year quarter, we saw a far more cautious spending by a number of our larger pharmaceutical companies customers in the United States, Europe and Japan, which affected our mass spec sales in particular. During the third quarter, Applera filed a registration statement with the SEC to make possible the spin off of Celera. We remain hopeful that the spin off can be completed by June 30, which is the end of our current fiscal year. Following the spin off, our intention is to retire the Applera name and re-brand the company under the name Applied Biosystems, Inc. Investors have asked about restrictions on Applied Biosystems in the in vitro diagnostics field if Celera becomes an independent company. The answer to this question is that the operating principles Applied Biosystems and Celera have agreed to as part of the proposed separation put time-limited constraints on Applied Biosystems. There is a three-year transition period during which Applied Biosystems has generally agreed not to commercialize assays or OEM instruments which compete with a defined set of Celera assays. These restrictions will end after three years. Applied Biosystems will continue with product supply arrangements with Celera. The specifics are set out in the registration statement. Among the emerging opportunities in the broader healthcare market, molecular diagnostics may be a logical area for expansion for Applied Biosystems for the longer term, and one that fits with our strategy of applying our technologies outside the research field. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark?Thanks Tony. Today I'm going to start with a high-level commentary about each of our specific product lines and platforms. I'll then give you some additional color on two important topics: SOLiD Next Generation Sequencing system development and our internal infrastructure project. I'm extremely proud of how our teams have executed in both of these areas. With DNA sequencing in transition, we are extremely pleased with the development progress we have made in Q3 with our SOLiD system and with the way we are managing through the market transition. As expected, CE instrument placements are declining in the research market as instrument funding priorities shift toward next-generation sequencing platforms. But CE consumables volumes continue to grow. CE instrument revenues in applied markets were also up during the quarter for both human identity and for quality and safety testing. We continue to see good growth opportunity in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, where operators need to routinely monitor their products for the presence of bacterial and fungal contaminants. We recognized revenue in the third quarter for SOLiD shipments that we made during our second quarter, the December quarter, as units passed customer acceptance requirements. As indicated in our last call, in January, we purposefully constrained shipments of SOLiD systems to new customers while we focused on supporting our existing customers and further improving the system. We are pleased that we are now past this stage. Next month we plan to ship, on an unrestricted basis, a significantly upgraded version of the SOLiD platform, one that will enable customers to double the throughput to 6 gigabases per run, in far less time than the previous version. With this new upgrade, we continue to lead the next-generation field in platform performance, and we believe that no one else comes close to our combination of throughput and accuracy. Just as important, we have a long runway in front of us and are convinced that SOLiD is the most scalable of the next-generation technologies on the market today. We have early-access upgrade customers who are already generating nearly 10 Gigs of data per run, while our research team has reported runs with significantly higher throughput. And our pipeline is filled with developing methods to automate and further reduce front-end time and to optimize new applications development. With the progress we are making with our SOLiD system, we're confident that we are on our way to restoring our sequencing business as an overall contributor to the growth of Applied Biosystems. The Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics category continues to be both our largest at 36% of revenue, and our fastest grower, weighing in with another 10% growth over the prior year quarter. PCR-based research consumables, which are recorded in this category, include our Ambion products, TaqMan assays, real-time PCR master mixes for, both, genotyping and gene expression. Consumables revenues for DNA forensics and other applied markets are also included. The product lines I've just mentioned all contributed to the category growth in this quarter. On the instrument side of real-time PCR, we are seeing strong demand for StepOne products we introduced last year. These have set a new standard for ease-of-use and accessibility, and we are pleased that StepOne won the SelectScience Award for the best new Life Science product in 2007. Our real-time PCR group now has a very strong new product pipeline. And even though our TaqMan assays are already the gold standard, we continue to improve the workflows, to develop related enzymes and master mixes, and to introduce performance-enhanced application-specific TaqMan assays. In the last two months alone, we've introduced and announced three new sets of gene expression tools: one for faster answers from cell-based samples; one for microRNA profiling; one for performing digital gene expression research on our SOLiD system. We also introduced a new family of reagents for reverse transcription PCR. And in the forensic area, during the quarter, in addition to strong operating performance, we introduced some powerful new software tools including for our Chinese customers a Mandarin-language forensic package. And in the forensic fast-growing food quality and safety testing area, we announced that we will begin to sell pathogen detection kits directly to end users while continuing to supply instruments and reagents to DuPont Qualicon under an updated collaboration agreement. We introduced a salmonella test kit as part of the new direct-sales strategy and have several additional food pathogen assays in development. The Mass Spectrometry product revenue category increased approximately 1% compared to a tough comp in the prior year quarter when revenues rose nearly 12%. In addition to the tough comp, we're facing a weakening in economic and budgeting climate. We are challenged by constrained capital spending in pharma markets, particularly in Europe and Japan but also in the United States. Pharma spending has been offset somewhat by the shift to CROs where we have a broad footprint and strong market position. Our Applied Markets mass spec showed continued strength in North America and in Asia, particularly in China. In fact, our high-end QTRAP and triple quad product exhibited good uptake in Applied Markets for applications like quality and safety monitoring in food and beverage markets and environmental testing. Overall we continue to see the mass spec market as one of the most competitive markets we participate in with some current challenges in customer spending patterns and both new and established players strengthening and broadening their offerings in both product types and application areas. We fully recognize the need to reignite growth in this category. Recently, we introduced a variety of software packages that improve ease-of-use and productivity, which are particularly important for applied markets application. In the mass spec area, we are focused on providing the required combination of new platforms, new software and new workflows for the high-growth markets we are in. I now want to add some additional color to the quarter. In many ways, Q3 was all about execution of our plans. Next-generation sequencing was the most obvious example, and our development teams deserve special mention for the work they've done in bringing an upgraded platform to market. From a customer standpoint, we have already made significant progress and a subsequent round of improvements that we expect will continue to position SOLiD as the performance leader in the field and drive even more experimental value into the marketplace. And finally, I want to recognize some ongoing work, the results of which have been seen indirectly by the Street in our earnings growth. These results have been achieved by the team driving our infrastructure project. During this fiscal year, in addition to goals to drive revenue, we also set productivity goals to improve costs and margins that would both improve our earnings growth and free funds for re-investment in growth initiatives. As one example, R&D productivity and the number of new product introductions... especially in consumables... have increased dramatically this year, even in the face of decreased overall research spending, underscoring the benefits of this renewed focus. The operational improvements we have made have been the result of the collective efforts of many people and functions across AB that have delivered well beyond our internal targets resulting in continued strong earnings growth. And now Dennis Winger will comment on Applied Biosystems' financial results for the quarter.Thank you, Mark. As mentioned, our third quarter results were highlighted by solid gross and operating margins and strong EPS growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis compared to the prior year quarter. Gross margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was 56.9% compared to 56.5% in the prior year quarter. The favorable effect of foreign currency was the primary factor contributing to the improvement. During the third quarter SG&A expenditures increased 6% from the prior-year level primarily due to employee-related costs, the unfavorable impact of currency and regional investments. R&D expenditures decreased 11% in the third quarter from the prior year period due principally to lower employee-related costs and the termination in June 2007 of a contract for the U.S. Department of Defense. Third quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.44, an increase of approximately 22% compared to $0.36 in the prior year period. Excluding foreign currency, non-GAAP earnings per share increased approximately 11% over the prior year. The Group's accelerated share repurchase transaction completed in January 2008 was accretive to the quarterly per-share results by approximately $0.01. To reiterate our comment made in January on the last earnings call, we continue to expect the accelerated share repurchase transaction to be accretive to Applied Biosystems' fiscal 2008 earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. We did not make any open-market purchases of Applied Biosystems' shares during the third quarter as we decided not to repurchase shares while we are finalizing the spin off of Celera from Applera. Our intention is to resume open-market share repurchases after we have finalized the registration statement and we are not in a quiet period. Since 2002 we have repurchased $1.8 billion of Applied Biosystems' shares. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release as well on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website, www.appliedbiosystems.com. Cash flow from continuing operations during the third quarter was strong at $119 million and capital expenditures were $11 million. At the end of the third quarter accounts receivable were $459 million, representing 62 days sales outstanding, and inventory was $172 million, representing 3.9 months of inventory on hand. As of the end of the quarter, cash and short term investments were $365 million, down from $495 million as of June 30, 2007. This decrease was largely the result of $602 million payment to Morgan Stanley for our accelerated share repurchase transaction, a portion of which was funded with the available cash and the balance of which was funded by $275 million in short-term debt. We have repaid $150 million of these borrowings, leaving $125 million outstanding as of the end of the quarter. Regarding Applied Biosystems' expectations about its financial performance for fiscal 2008, I would refer you to today's earnings release. Other than capital expenditures, we have made no changes to our outlook compared to that issued with the second quarter results. That said, I will provide an abbreviated version of what we are forecasting. At current currency rates, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth, with revenues comparable to prior year level for Instruments and up for consumables. We also anticipate growth across all product categories with the exception of other product lines. We anticipate gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 and we expect to increase operating margin in 2008 by at least 200 basis point compared to the prior fiscal year. Finally, we expect non-GAAP EPS to exhibit double-digit growth compared to fiscal 2007. We now expect CapEx for the fiscal year to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million... slightly lower than we projected last quarter. We'll now be happy to take your questions about Applied Biosystems. Question And Answer[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Corporation [Cowen and Company]. You may proceed.Hi, good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions. Across tools at this point I think it's fair to say and this is consistent with what you said in your prepared remarks that firming demand for instrumentation has been a key driver to weakness in certain areas where it looks like consumables demand has held up, especially at pharma and I would say more so in another areas. With that as a backdrop, I'm still looking for some answers on real-time PCR performance in the quarter. Maybe it's just our model, but you did come up light of our forecast for year-over-year and sequential growth. And I was wondering if could provide some colors specifically on whether real-time PCR results were affected, maybe positively or negatively, by instrument or consumable mix or were there any dynamics in end user demand during the quarter and how do these dynamics look moving forward?Hi, Doug, it is Mark. Okay, so I'll take that question. So maybe just crossing it out. On the pharma side, certainly we saw... particularly towards the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Just pharma requiring some extra signatures, a bit more consolidation going on in pharma and that does tend to impact a small part of the instruments in real-time PCR. But the main part of the... light going on in instruments is just a wider adoption of real-time PCR. So we see a shift to adoption like the kind of products I mentioned in StepOne, StepOne Plus, and that's really where we see the market growth is going on and that's where we participated. Now within that category, as you also mentioned, a lot of that category is actually now consumables and we saw good strong growth in the consumables that category for us continues to perform very well. It's a series of different products, here as mentioned, the range across the research areas going to forensic and applied. So there is quite a mixture within what's going on within that real-time PCR category and some is the market-specific of pharma but you are going to expect continued strong growth in that category going forward as we continue to drive more consumable products into that category.Okay, that's helpful, any change in royalty performance Q to Q in that line item, that was of note that that would bounce back maybe next quarter?We don't disclose that.Okay, I took a shot, and... almost got you. Quick one on NASDAQ, I don't think it's used anybody about the performance they are across the market. Anything you can share in the way of competitive dynamics there, anything you have seen to that is affecting performance or do you thing that is mostly a market wide dynamic that's going on there?Hi, this is Laura. I think by in large, the business is really affected by the Pharma slow down and really delays in funding, that really affected the business primarily. There is still is some competitive or strong competition at the low end of the market but that's been ongoing quarter-to-quarter.Okay, and maybe I can just ask one last one, going back to your Q4 commentary... on your Q4 call last year. Is that when you guys first announced the accelerated time line associated with the solid roll out and at that point you seen pretty confident that you were in a rush to product out if you don't think it was ready and you rolled the product out in October of course, on your fiscal Q2 call of this year as you were eluded to today or mention today you purposely think strengths SOLiD shipments that you need through that you are allocating sufficient resources to the roll out, sounds like we are moving past that now, but maybe can you give us a little bit more color on maybe what developments surprised over the past nine months and if you roll out for SOLiD upgrade and how do we, maybe more importantly, the scientific community get comfortable that the challenges, is that challenge, is that's the right to describe on that you have faced in the early going of the SOLiD roll out don't continue with the upgrade of the instrument roll out. Thank you.Dough, yeah, when you speaking of very exciting toll during the last year, we sold it... and actually we got to say we are pretty pleased with where we are, you see from a covenants in our interim and we've made a tremendous progress when are rolling down just about and we said the custom is... here what we got and get one dig. We started talking in the October call that we thought we could get may be increase may be up to 9 or 10, and here we are launching 60 system and we are seeing customers that are exceeding that. So actually we are being conservative here what we are explaining. What the community was ought to see is it's customers presenting data on that, so that will really support that, you will also see from our press release this morning customers like genome centers like Bella engaging in the 1000 Genomes Project and deciding to scale up on the SOLiD technology, if you look back to the conference in AGBT Applied, they were presenting the accuracy of the data and just getting going, but now they have a chance to work with the systems, see the throughput... they have made the choice to scale up with SOLiD. As you roll out during this quarter you will see posters coming forward, for example of the Cold Stream Harbor meeting in May showing both the applications on the Genome variance as well as gene expression studies that are going on. Year You will see this increasing momentum going on, this coverage of course prove what translates to a lower project cost, so you saw us make the announcement from the R&D team of doing a genome for $60,000. You see us this through put translate into cost program, cost projects. We expect increasingly people are going to say, Okay, now let's think about these new projects, we can do SOLiD And so we feel we got good momentum going on. We also adjust that participated in field applications training, we brought nearly 50 people in to cost of city that they had to get up, updated training on this as in 2.0 was starting to launch and very exciting as we support our existing customers and roll this out, so we are feeling very good about the progress we have made in this year, and I think you will just see continued good news coming forward here now.Great, thank you very much.And our next question come from the line of Peterson Tycho of J.P. Morgan, you may proceed.Hi Good morning, may be just following up on your comments Mark, on SOLiD, I appreciate the color, could give us a sense to what you are seeing in terms of validation times now and how quickly you start to see the consumable ramp up and then also the geographically are you seeing interest in SOLiD outside the U.S. and then between the core genome centers and outside genome centers if there any color there, it will be helpful.Yes, firstly on the ramp up times so that's certainly accelerating, one of the things that we have done is have given ourselves more time to adjust to validation and verification testing in-house and as we do that and get more experience as in stores and shipping, the in-stores were done recently, had been quicker and we get through acceptance test, and we do expect that to translate to more consumables getting online quicker. Its obviously a very dynamic environment as we try to model it on those, you try to model it and so give you as much color on some of these data points going forward but that's kind of where we were, or are with it, so there is third part...And yeah just trying to kind of think about the demand outside the U.S. and also within the U.S. in terms of core genome centers and outside the genome centers.Yeah so we are seeing good demand throughout the world I would say, this last quarter I have mentioned the people we started as well as shipping here in the U.S. we shifted at the end of the quarter into Japan, as it was there fiscal year ends, so we seeing good tomorrow and going on there, and I had mentioned I've been... about my trip in February to India that we weren't ready to start shipping to countries like that but actually we have just started taking orders in other places like that, so we see it internationally in Europe in Asia, and I think you would also see those announcement out from BGLI, as they build up installations in China as well, so it is pretty widely spread, you see customers in Canada scaling out as it all, much more in traditional genome centers scaling up outside the big five. And we continue to work with both of the big 5 genome centers and also other centers as they get up and running in their different projects.Okay with regards to some of the productivity initiatives you discussed, can you give us a sense as to what you know the key steps here are the key focus areas are, I know you talked a little bit about the R&D rationalization and focusing on more productive projects, but as we think about that 200 basis points operating margin expansion, can you give us a sense as to how much would that may come from, better cost rationalization?Well I highlighted one of the areas... as you say Tycho was around the R&D, both the prioritization and just the portfolio process we now have going linking to our strategy which gives us a much better price line and after that then there was a series of other project that continue to look at both the gross margin level where can we have the opportunity in cost and efficiencies in manufacturing, you know as now, coming up the period as nearly two years, with the ambient integration and we continue to make improvement both if we book volume into that and also make improvement in to that and also make improvements in the manufacturing system down in Austin, and we are please with the progress we are making there and we continue to look at that sort of global infrastructure, whether the cost that are not essential to driving and supporting our business and can we leave our job our footprint in a better way, can we serve our customers in a better way, so there is a series of other initiatives that we continue to drive that productivity.Okay, as we think about the real-time PCR business going forward maybe some of the opportunities to multiplexing, can you give us some incremental commentary on BioTrove and how you looking at that market opportunity in that collaboration?Probably the collaboration is going very well, we just passed one of our internal milestone checkpoints. And the collaboration between the two organizations and sort of West Coast collaborations is also going very, very well, so we are on track, we were really looking at that market obviously a physical multiplexing to TaqMan assays into 3000 well format, and we just see that the sort of ultimate flexibility you have in that, the samples against assay. There is really a lot of flexibility end by end as you think about, how do you line up the content that we've got in the TaqMan assays that are available on our Website on our assay then to be seamlessly ordered and put into a format that can be run in these screening experiments either in clinical trial in studies and at bio customers. These are some of the initial customers showing a lot of interest in these applications. And we will be rolling this out into next fiscal year, and we think it will be big part of the continued growth for the real-time PCR category in the genotyping part of our franchise.Okay, thanks, finally Denise you had made a comment about your ability to repurchase share, and when do you expect you may start being able to doing I know you said right now right now your not.We are not going to do it till after we complete the separations so which we are currently hoping to as target by June 30th and likely we probably won't be able to commence till after we have released year-end earnings because we'll be in the quite period of that point. But there are only certain times that we can commence to put a share repurchase program typically it's after earnings have been out 2 or 3 days. So the most likely scenarios will be back in the market late July, early August.Okay thank you very much.Thanks.And your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffrey. You may proceed.Thanks Good morning. Mark just kind of continue don't mean to make this a solid call but I just want to ask you about if we took out the contributions from the next generation sequencing side, did we see an improvement at all to the underlying sequencing growth rate, I guess thinking about this in a constant currency standpoint from recent quarters. Let me repeat that, see if I can suffice. So, if we take out SOLiD, the sequencing business is running at a kind of mid single-digit negative constant currency growth number and is that a fair way to continue to think about the business guys or do we see a change in that trend in this most recent quarter.Yes so the way we think about this business actually, and we are not going to break it out further for you, it is as a whole sequencing it's a genomic analysis business, so we are managing through there's a lot of interest in the variation that goes on in sequencing, it turns out there is more structure analysis work to be done. It's also further complicated of course by a gene expression business as well. So we are seeing customers beginning to adopt the gene expression studies and the throughput and the amount of ability to do this tag based counting, takes us into new application areas. So the way we think about the business and the way you have got to think about the business as sort of as a category, this is a category where we are transitioning from how you do genomic analysis in some applications in the research area on a CE-based platform to take in this technology and this technology has got a lot of headroom in front of it, to grow that category. In addition, what you think about is some of the applications are going to continue to grow as we called out, the consumables continue to grow and that shows the installed basis that's out there, it's still driving those applications and still running that work. We also called out that the customers that are more validated environments appreciate a robust, easy to use system, continue to grow. Even as we've have had strong growth in new instrument placement, so in the HIV and forensic area, in the pharmaceutical customers, in the production environment, we are seeing growth in those segments, so we are not going break out all the individual moving parts as you came from explanation, a lot of different applications in there, but you should think about it as a whole category and as I made in my comments this is the category that we believe is returning to growth and its part of the transition we have made in this business, so we are feeing pretty good about that. Yes, I think that I'd just turn to exclamation point, we look at sequencing business as a total business and SOLiD is a product line within there, with our goal and I think we are going to achieve is to get that whole business, that whole $570 million business growing again and obviously SOLiD and its various applications are going to help drive that but the expectation we want to create is we think can achieve it is to get the overall sequencing business are growing and soluble will certainly play major role in that. And so Tony remarks, it's safe to say then at the underlying trend and some of the sub sectors if you will since sequencing and I have been thinking this specifically about forensic. That trend of, a positive trend continues innovative.It does. We are seeing an expand... the application for sequencing capillary electrophoresis sequencing, sort of outside the high throughput genome area and particular in the Applied Markets has a positive trend. There is some dislocation in the mid range today in the research markets, because people have all their attention on writing brands for next gen projects and that sort of things. There has been some slowdown there, we think that's... we think we understand that we are not too concerned about it. The applications of Forensics and other areas pharma QC, is stuff what looks like it has a lots of potential and we really start to see that develop at a faster pace of anything. So it's the totality of all of this that we think is going to get the overall sequencing business back to a reasonable growth period.Understood thanks guys.And the next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird. You may proceed.Thank you, good morning. Looking again back at to mass spec business some of the competitors have reported this earnings season, they have also started delays, but no ones talked anything about cancellations... and one competitor actually said that in April things look more cautiously optimistic. Could you currently deliver the color on that commentary Laura?Sir I think we are on to. Right now there is a pharma accounts are singling delays. There are few that is actually said there is loss in funding. I think it's too uncertain right now to say forward what's going to happen. I have seen several cycles now with the funding has come back obviously over time the pharmaceutical companies will start to purchase again but the timing of that right now is unclear.But then on the... as you said in your prepared remarks on that the Applied markets, any idea of ...that the funding for that, visibility seems to be good, or at least the spending so far is good, what about the visibility in those markets?In Applied markets, the business is strong there at the end of the top of the much smaller base we've had significant growth in the food and environmental application areas and that's been a very solid state throughout.and then going back to consumables, one of thing that some of the companies have decided is ...the calendar effect in Easter and offsetting some of that, some people have increased some of their prices, how did that affects you consumables business this past quarter?Well, we certainly have the same calendar, the same effect that we had Easter there I think experienced that and certainly as we, we become more of consumables company as you see 42% of that revenue now coming in consumables, your going to track some of that weekly, performance is important to us. As we go at the pricing, there is nothing specific, we've changed in the pricing mix. Our focus is been into increase, introduce new products that are going to improved the performance I've just made the work flow easier which then allow us to take market share away from our competitors.Great, thank you.The weak dollar is in fact the price increase in over the half our customers so I think about ...where our customers are outside the U.S. weak dollar is the fact of pricing critical.And the next question comes from the line Dan Leonard from First Analysis. You may proceed.Hi Good morning. Mark, my first question is about your guidance for the, for I guess the last quarter. Your revenue guidance, you mentioned that you haven't changed any of the language except for the capital expenditure but the dollar is weakened about 8% versus the euro and some other major currencies since your last offered guidance year. Your effectively looking for weaker organic growth, and I'm wondering is there any specific business that has come inside your expectations, and where you are looking forward to be shy for your expectations from a couple of months ago.Well, we didn't change the language because we can get in the somewhere and splitting of hairs here in terms of few million dollars but its some of the stuff around. But if I had to put my finger on one area that is probably new versus last quarter is the uncertainly of mass effect. We were quite surprised, our field was quite surprised as how the weakness developed in the last few weeks of quarters in that business, and what I would like to think it was a temporary development nor have any evidence to the contrary so that probably fills up whatever difference there might be in the sense of there.Okay, thank you. And then my other question for Mark, on the head room you have installed, do you have a timeline or can you offer us a timeline at when additional improvements will role out throughout the year? We do have a time line and the head room is there, I m not going to announce the full timeline on this call, obviously I appreciate it's a very competitive space and sir, we want to continue to roll out improvements to our customers without time. I think you got a sense and I have talked about sometimes following more roll here that as we go across each quarter we have been increasingly the improved cost selling out 1 Gig, 3 Gigs, 6 Gigs. So you are getting a sense of where we are and the kind of pace of improvement we see. And I've also commented that we're really just getting going on some of this technology. So, so far what we've been optimizing is sort of the runtime some of the molecular biology, just how to be support. So some of these things we knew when we acquired the technology, get it working get the technology out there, improve the robustness but as we go forward we're also looking at more end to end systems and opportunities to improve it even further is in our roadmap as we look out but the one to two year horizon but also as we're looking out five years in this technology, we can see where we would like to go and you will see continual improvements because we think the headroom is there in this system. I mean ...again that's a critical point about SOLiD. Yes, we are late into the market versus competitors that have been out a year more ahead of us. And its always uncomfortable to have to play the catch up game and all of the things that go with it but we are very deliberately chose this technology because while we had to sacrifice advantage in the short term because of the timing and the development of the technology we felt that the long term advantages were substantial and compelling. And I think we're starting to see that now the ... in our hands these things ... in the customers hand its improves six fold in productivity in a few months and in our laboratory its far more than that and we ...as I talk to the scientist main stairs I think they are thinking about levels of productivity and improvement that would be shocking and when you do that, its going to open up a new applications. Applications outside of deploying some of the 16 projects we've seen, part mentioned Gene Expressions others. So there is ... so one other difficulty you have and trying to describe to people when we're going to see big improvements is, what do you mean by that, we see a long time for this technology is going to continue to have as Mark, Paul said as the limits to this technology are far more impressive than anything else that we have not fairly said before we make this choice and so we are going to, you can bet we are going to put everything we got into exploring those revenues, and I think you will see positive news from this product line for many years to come and a developing competitive advantage as a result of it.Okay, thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson, from Thomas Weisel Partners you may proceed.Denis what's been driving the gross margin expansions and what elements where not as sustainable?I think a couple of things, one is obviously, currency we highlighted in the press release, and also as you know we have converted some of that and our manufacturing to self manufacturing and renegotiated the contracts using and time to resource on our ties and those contracts are more favorable it's the...Having self manufacture it was already the enzymes have given us a very negotiating leverage, as far as other enzymes that we source from third party, so those are the two primary sectors, possibly a focus on, can't really focus on try and improve our operating deficiencies in the manufacturing area, are the three main factors.I would add that our product mix is moving more towards sustainable growth market, subject to.How big is FX in the course for gross margins?I don't know but I have that data with...less then 1 point.Okay and then how do you Applied markets been growing for you?Its been very... very strong contributor to growth or is, there is difference sub segments and we are being carefully going one by one entering these markets, the one we've have been talked about from the DNA side is forensic which we have seen continued good double-digit growth, expansion of the global data basis, around the world we see continued expansion here. We are hopeful of the renewed funding here going on in the U.S. and will continue to see the expansion in that marketplace. In other markets you see as in the mass spectrometery side... the drivers for food testing continue to be strong from mas pec, D&A and so we are leveraging our technology over that making call assistance and you see in this bio pharmaceutical manufacturing areas, so these are the three specific markets we have been targeting and we see as we look out on our horizon and sort of do our planning going out into the more longer term, we will continue to see the shift of where our research customers base is but also where we are trying to grow our applied markets and that shift continuing to move as the applied market goes faster for us.How big is that applied markets for you now, and it seems that it's more of the same from last quarter, it's the same kind of things that are driving growth in that market?It's certainly fair to say and this is one of the things we liked about this market is a bit of consistency about it, compared to the research market where maybe new discoveries of non-coding RNA and we'll need to come up with new tools of microRNA to surpass the changing market. The applied markets has an much more even a run way ahead of it, the same drivers as a consistency to that and also utilizes to build up capabilities were being turned out say for validations, so when we take kits tool like the TaqMan assays, we get LAC approval, the body that approves that allows us to improve our quality standards and operate in these more validated markets, so that's kind of some of the changes we've been doing and that's kind of some of the changes we have been doing and you know as a percentage of the business I think we have broken out that where it was under 20% as a sort of total of the year, the profits we had this last fiscal year was getting close to the 25% of our business.Okay and then I kind of missed what was the weakness in the real-time PCR?Bob I think it is a mixture, you may have missed, because I may have missed as well, I see we do 10% and relatively we are already pleased with that 10% growth.It's indiscernible accelerating.What, what did you say?Sorry it has been decelerating so it is fine, so 10% growth that is prior quarter there has been a deceleration in that, is there any areas of weakness in that, has it been instrumentation that has been weaker for you or?But it is also getting a bigger proportion you got to keep in mind with that, it always took of our biggest categories, so just about mathematical nature of it, you know as it gets off to the time of the business it is, you know that does become mathematical part of the equation. So you are going to see a little bit of that in there you know there is a mixture of product lines in that, there is implied and the forensic are in there, you know I commented on some of the real-time PCR instrument side and you know that's not a new message on where we have been commenting and we see the shift is more the, I have focuses to go after the consumables with a part of that attachment to the system, rather than we are just selling the instruments, we are getting the complete system in their and that's part of the focus there. You know also the questions have been about Ambion. Two years from the integration, those if the gross driver for that portfolio, I would have been very pleased with the way we have taken these products and it continues to grow in strong double digits and it is part of that portfolio so that's all in there continuing to drive, we feel good about the category.Okay thank you for taking my questions..And the next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg. You may proceed.Thanks for taking my question, hi, good morning. I have just three questions, first congratulations on all the improvements you are making on SOLiD and I just want to understand Mark if there was any improvement in speeding up the process of recognizing revenues and I assume some of your that will... your main competitor recognized revenue and shipment and you guys are a bit longer in recognizing those revenues.Yes. Jonathan so may be firstly I just send poly [ph] thing as a company we have more conservative nature on some of our claims and some of our competitors so we tend to do that the same without customers, that we've hedged, we've given them a chance to install the system, run acceptance test with them and recognize revenue. What's certainly shortening is the time from getting the system, installing the system. I also commented well they're getting twice as much capacity out of each run, they're also dramatically reduced the run times, just the time to run those acceptant tests comes down. In sort of the period I do expect this revenue recognition will come down, and as you look out, we will go through more and more revenue recognition process, but our focus is making sure the customers are happy with this technology, is complicated for them to get up on running and get used to this amount of data coming out of a system. As they got to cope with all the bioinformatics pipeline, and that all needs validating and we're helping them get set ups so they can be produced them.So you given them some targets in the past. You made some improvement but kind of where are you if you give exact days or how long if theyWho said before... initially we said three months right, I don't know that we've gone out with any change to that but I know its shorter than that now, just don't know how much shorter do you.No. We are still guiding the targets that we are giving was we are recognize in revenue from shipments made in the prior quarter and we still didn't have a good way to think about it.The another way to look at is we have got some customers who in about one and then some are buying their 5th to 6th so there is very different scenario there to so we just haven't looked at what that average is and maybe we should and give you guys an update on it but for our internal purposes we use just like about a quarter and that's probably conservative now.Okay thanks. Next question had to do with I take the flipside of the gross margin argument if you can maybe just explain given this quarter it looks like you had a more favorable product mix from even the second quarter in terms of instruments versus consumables having more consumable sales and yet gross margins were down from your 58 to obviously high but maybe you can describe what caused the gross margins to go down as much as they did between quarters? What makes you think of SOLiD?Yes we commented actually on Q2 that there was some special factors that pushed it off in Q2 so I think look back on the Q2 comments made. Also in Q3 after them align it's the first time we have annualized the major step up, we commented about the enzyme improvement so that's in the Q3 part. As regard mix it's exactly as Tony, the number of moving parts in that mix is not just consumables instruments, we have also always said our instruments are about the same margins as consumables but mass speck mix has a change so there's a number of different things that move around as we go forward here.Well I think the first thing Mark said more important is the last quarter was probably out of sight.And then last question a lot of people have been asking about the real time PCR but it was the area that was striving a lot of growth and despite sequentially easier comps over 2007, that rate has been decelerating so may be you could just, you have talked a lot about of it may can you decouple within real time PCR, what instruments grew out versus consumables.Well, I guess the way you have got to think about it is Jonathan, what's going to drive the growth going forward, so in my comments I talked about the product pipe line in real time PCR is very productive, you see a series of new products coming out but are going to drive that forward and that's in there, you have got the applied markets growing forensic, you got new book-kits coming in, you got pharmaceutical manufacturing, so that's going to continue to drive growth coming forward and then we talked about the BioTrove and the introduction of new form factors, systems that will take our assays drive that growth out into new markets and that may turn to be genotyping space. So when you think about going forward, you have got to think about what historically we have done in that category, which is take that category a lot of people try to simply to simple, tat numbers, a lot of things in that category now, but we have added in that adds to the port folio products of the driving growth. So you can continue to think about it as a growth category, continue to think as growth coming from that area.Because there has been any change may then just discuss some from a different angles, from a competitive stand point, some competitors have talked about still high growth rates in real time PCR, so do feel like loosing share at all that in that business over the last couple of quarters or.Not want to look at size they are talking about you guys talked about deceleration in terms of percentage, it on a comparable basis, I think some of those concerns might go well I think. Yes we see the same competitive intensity that we are seeing, I remember talking about it might be a couple of quarters ago may be in a year ago real time areas competitive, it is competitive, it's being competitive, competitive has introduced new platforms, we introduced new platforms, new features and new systems that no change in that in from our point of view and there is no change in our market share from that point of view.Okay, thanks.And your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from UBS. You may proceed.Hi, you have actually forgotten me Tony.We fractionally do that.Is Mike as we may like to, but I wake up this morning I thought will I get to talk to there?I'm sure you did. Since you're going to hate for I'm going to ask next. Two questions, on the new version SOLiD 6x for run time I guess or I should dig in less run time. Could you quantify how much less run time and at the change of sample because you quantify the changes in sample that versus just actual weighing instruments?I am pretty sure I can't even begin to answer that but I bet Mark can.Firstly to the run time, its spends a little bit what your running as you know Derik we're getting into the details of make pairs or not. And typically looking at a time around five to six days, which is about half the time we were doing before. And on the sample prep it's improvement in the protocols and the robustness of those protocols some of the ease of use is number of... for the more detailed steps in that but have change part of the development we've made in just in fact the customers to increase to improve the steps, to go on informing the beads and high yield prepare their samples. So that's what improved.But the actual cycle time of the instrument hasn't really changed?But the cycle time is running and imaging has improved.It has. Okay, alright. So I may want to comeback to the PCR question and you have discontinued the microarray business I guess. Did that have any impact on the Applied Genomic sections, net whole business segment and also, Real-Time PCR, it uses a follow up for a lot of microarray expressions, microarray hit Gene Expressions determined, could you comment potentially that how that market is looking, given that, after metrics sounds like that it had hits recently and then I have a follow up to that.So yeah, firstly on the Gene expression array that was a very minor impact we noted in the business in that way, and just supported our customers transition that about business. With regard to the follow up studies on the micro RNA, we still see that tackling these to gold standard if people want to check that the time script is really there, and to try to go on and quantitate that work. So we continue to see that, work go on and that continues to be a driver of follow on studies, broadly what we are seeing is the drivers be more functional studies where you might, that just be following up the array but perhaps looking at the gene regulation using RNA melt down and then follow up that experiment with the Gene Expression time as well. So that's kind of way we're seeing, some of the work going on and then obviously you get sets of targets and put them into the screening experiments and run that through which is obviously where we are targeting as we look at expanded densities and we look at options to take what has been very successful for as our micro fluidic card into different formats or content.And speaking of the micro fluidic card, in addition to bio attributors and other platforms out there that are starting to come in here and in the validation part and certainly you have got to do the launching the bid express platforms for doing a lot of their things. Is...are you seeing any hit your reagent sales in PCR from some of these applications which are coming in?No, I mean that ... we got to separate up the Gene Expression part. So the Gene Expression we're continuously seeing...This actually I've been hearing.And focus on that. In the genotyping space, using TaqMan for genotyping that's where we see the expansion opportunities for growth... to go back in to take the space in between what would be the high density array, that will all be done by sequencing, of course sequencing comes into that as a higher density form or you can think of find a way of doing the gene type of experiment. And so that's how we think about and see the market. Its also different types of customers since you have a better markets, some of these are big centers and more the genotype in projects with the decentralized things your tax tends to be smaller groups during follow up studies typically where we ...do you see just much more raw expense.Okay. And then one final question. Can ... are we expecting any thing, are you expecting to have new products at the SMS?Derik, you're making me smile. Well, I guess that late assignment is for always working on, my answer here will always work down new software, new applications and new hardware and we are going to continue to do that in first vehicle future.But it is our policy not to comment on new product launches until we have to launch them in the aspect area.That's true, Derik we typically don't reintroduce new product.That was a good try, Derik.I'm just doing my job. Alright. Thank you. I'll hang around for the next round.Thank you, Derik. Now we are going to move on to the second half of our call today.No questions.Yes, it is. And in the second half of the call, Tony White will make introductory remarks about Celera, and then Celera President Kathy Ordoñez will review the Celera business. Also on the call today for the Q&A portion are other Celera and Berkeley Heart executives as well as David Speechly, Senior Director for IR, for Celera. For those who may have just joined us this morning, please note that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements about the Company's businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure that are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in Applera's filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for Celera. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials for Celera can be found in today's press release and on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of the Celera website at www.celera.com.Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone. I'm encouraged with the continued progress at Celera this quarter as the management team has made substantial progress on the integration of Berkeley HeartLabs, or BHL, and Atria Genetics. The commercial and organizational focus that has been implemented over recent quarters has starting to gain traction, resulting in a business with a stronger financial profile. With a strong balance sheet, Celera is in a good position to exploit the growth opportunities in molecular diagnostics and personalized disease management. The business is still expected to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for the year, and as planned, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission this last quarter in an effort to complete the separation of the Celera and Applied Biosystems businesses by the end of the current fiscal year. I'll now hand it over to Kathy who will discuss Celera in more detail.Thank you Tony and good morning everyone. This was another productive period for us across all parts of our business. Our recent acquisitions of BHL and Atria Genetics continued to contribute both financially and strategically this quarter, while sales in our alliance with Abbott grew. We also made substantial progress in our cardiovascular programs, particularly around the development of our KIF6 assay, which are expected to contribute to the future of our business. As described in our registration statement, we now have three categories of revenue: revenues from services, consisting primarily of sales by BHL, revenues from product sales, which include equalization payments from our alliance with Abbott Laboratories; and, lastly, the revenues from licensing and collaboration activities. I'll start by describing our service business, which contributed $22.6 million of revenues during the third quarter of fiscal 2008, representing more than half of Celera's total revenue for the period. There are two key components to our strategy for growth within the BHL business: first to increase the number of patients and physicians participating in the Berkeley program, and second, to expand the menu of tests performed at BHL. During the quarter, we continued to add resources in the field at BHL and expanded our presence and focus on selected market areas as we seek to identify more physicians and patients to participate in the Berkeley program, We have completed the training of most of our new hires and rolled out new tools to support the sales effort. Most of the field positions that we had planned for a few months ago have since been filled. In January, we opened an important 4myHeart Center in Englewood, New Jersey and currently have 18 4myHeart centers operational, supported by additional clinical educators who are mobile or supporting patients by phone. We are now seeing an uptake in sample volume in the laboratory as a result of these efforts. Our second strategy for BHL's growth entails adding relevant new tests to the menu. Following the publication of 3 papers on Celera's findings around KIF6 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in January, BHL completed the development and validation of a laboratory service assay for KIF6 status in the middle of March, and began offering the test to a select group of physicians participating in a trial market. Uptake of the KIF6 assay to date has been strong, and thus far appears to be outperforming previously successful trial markets conducted by BHL for Apo E, NT-proBNP, and Lp-PLA 2 tests at the same stage of trial marketing. The test market is expected to refine pricing and positioning for the KIF6 assay and also determine how the test will be reimbursed by major payors. The trial market activities for KIF6 are targeted to be completed by the end of the current quarter, in anticipation of a full scale launch of the KIF6 testing service at BHL over the summer. As a reminder, KIF6 is a novel gene variant that conveys up to 55% increased risk for coronary events versus people who do not have the risk form of the gene. This incremental genetic risk for coronary heart disease has been shown to be essentially mitigated by statin therapy. KIF6 is the most advanced of a number of new tests that are in various stages of development at Celera and have the potential to expand the menu of tests offered by BHL. Another example was reflected in the publication of a paper in the Journa in March based on our collaboration with scientists at the University of Leiden in The Netherlands that identified several novel gene variants that are each associated with approximately 50 percent increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Other findings of our research could lead to potential tests that identify people who benefit from aspirin therapy and others that identify those people at elevated risk for stroke and early MI, or early heart attack. All of these complement the BHL vision for personalized disease management. Celera's pipeline of diagnostic discoveries and their application in personalizing disease management was integral to our thinking in making the acquisition of BHL. I'll turn now to the performance of our diagnostic, or IVD, product sales category that includes equalization payments from Abbott. This category also consists of Celera's portion of sales of Atria human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, products and shipments of Celera-manufactured products to Abbott, at cost. Product sales in this category grew by 44% in this last quarter to $9.1 million from $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. Total end-user alliance sales was $30.8 million compared to $24.3 million in the prior year quarter, and the equalization payment from Abbott in this last quarter was $4 million compared to $3.7 million in the same period a year ago. Increased volume of HIV, HCV and HBV Real Time viral load assays used on the m 2000system and thrombosis ASRs all contributed to the year-over-year growth. These increased sales were partially offset by lower sales of cystic fibrosis reagents and the removal of HCV genotyping ASRs in the U.S. and a CE marked product in Europe due to an injunction against sales of these products by Abbott previously issued in litigation with Innogenetics. As described in today's press release, Abbott and Innogenetics settled this litigation this month, and these products have already been... reintroduced onto the menu of products offered through the alliance. Efforts are also underway to register the HCV genotyping assays for use on the m 2000 system. We were pleased with the sustained penetration of the m 2000 system in its existing markets in this last quarter, as the system continues to contribute substantially to the growth of alliance end-user sales. Last week, on its first quarter 2008 earnings conference call, Abbott reported that the m 2000 Real Time PCR system continues to gain share worldwide, with more than 450 instrument placements at over 300 customers. There were other advancements for new products and development that our part of our alliance with Abbott. First, the Chlamydia and gonorrhea assays that run on the m 2000 system are under review with the FDA. These tests, which are already marketed in Europe, are expected to achieve FDA clearance and commercialization in the U.S. over the summer. Secondly, the alliance has developed an m2000 assay for human papillomavirus, or HPV. We have been working on this project for several years and anticipate this new test could be approved for launch in Europe during the first half of calendar 2009. A third development is in the HLA product line within the recently acquired Atria portfolio. During the quarter, we were awarded a bone marrow registry tender by the French National Blood Service for high resolution HLA typing using Celera's HLA sequencing based testing products. The term of the award is for three years and is effective immediately. It is anticipated that approximately 45,000 individuals will be tested over the coming the years, with each one tested over multiple loci representing approximately for 200,000 HLA tests performed on these repository samples. Separately, data on a new chimerism [ph] HLA product that assesses engraftment success was presented at the European Federation for Immunogentics in [Technical Difficulty] France. This new product may have utility with both bone marrow and SOLiD organ transplants, and since the test is expected to be performed multiple times on a transplant patient, we believe it could add substantially to the Atria business. In the third category of revenues from royalties, licensing and milestones, revenues were $7.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to $3.5 million in the prior year quarter with the increase due primarily to higher licensing and royalty revenues. In April we licensed up to ten cancer targets to Merck for the development of RNAi-based therapeutics and continue to make progress in previously announced pharmacogenomic collaborations with Ipsen and Merck. Lastly, we have now completed the rebalancing of our R&D resources and other activities in line with our current business activities. This resulted in a charge of $2.2 million in the quarter. In closing, we're pleased with the developments and growth across all parts of our business. We're encouraged by the integration to date of BHL and Atria into Celera and with the consequent expansion of revenues from these sources, as well as the growth of our IVD product business. We anticipate the expansion of the service menu through the broad commercial launch of KIF6 testing over the summer, and this test is likely to contribute visibly to service revenues in our next fiscal year. With a balanced portfolio of revenues across products and services, we see opportunity for further improvement as we manage our pipeline of products in development more strategically and inject further discipline into our operations. Based on the performance this quarter, and thus far year-to-date, we're tracking toward our stated goal of profitability on a non-GAAP basis for the fiscal year. We're also working diligently to prepare for the planned separation from Applera by the end of June. Now, Dennis Winger will make a few comments regarding the financial results for Celera and our financial outlook for fiscal 2008.Thank you, Kathy. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, Celera reported a net loss of $7.4 million, or $0.09 per share, due to factors outlined in today's press release, compared to a net loss of $4.5 million, or $0.06 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Reported revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were $39.5 million, compared to $9.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Excluding revenues that were derived from services and products related to the BHL and Atria acquisitions, Celera's reported revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 increased $4.9 million compared with the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher licensing and royalty revenues and a slightly higher equalization payment from Abbott. In the recent quarter, R&D expenses decreased by $2.8 million compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to reduced spending in proteomics discovery efforts. SG&A expenses increased by $14.2 million in this last quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting expenditures relating to BHL service revenues. Celera ended the recent quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $338 million, down about $4 million in the quarter. The guidance that we can provide for Celera for the remainder of fiscal 2008 is as follows: Total reported revenues are anticipated to be $135 - $140 million range. Reported R&D expenses are anticipated to be between $40 - $50 million, and SG&A expenses are anticipated to be between $70 to $75 million. Celera anticipates that it will be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for fiscal 2008, although non-GAAP earnings may be near break-even for the fourth quarter, which is expected to include, among other things, ongoing integration expenses from the Berkeley HeartLab and Atria Genetics acquisitions and internal costs incurred in preparation becoming an independent public company. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today's press release as well as on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website, www.celera.com. Amortization of intangibles relating to acquisitions, which are excluded in the determination of non-GAAP earnings per share, are expected to be approximately $0.06 per share for the fiscal year. The total pre-tax impact of FAS 123R in fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately $6.5 million, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.05. Celera currently anticipates it will end the fiscal year with $330 - $340 million in cash and short-term investments, due in part to payments to the alliance with Abbott for the settlement charge associated with the Innogenetics litigation and working capital requirements. The Group believes this outlook and its financial performance could be affected by a number of factors and other risks and uncertainties outlined in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC. These comments reflect management's current outlook. Applera does not have any current intention to update this outlook and plans to revisit the outlook for its businesses only once each quarter when financial results are announced. We will now be happy to take your questions regarding Celera. Question And Answer[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sarah Michael [ph] from Cowen. You may proceed.Thank you, I was wondering Kathy, can you just remind us how bigger product the in genetic compared to the HCP genotype in product was prior to that, didn't take in of the market, is it really material amount of profiting revenue when it gets to you guys and just a clarification on Dennis' comments, how does the... your portion of the inogenic [ph] settlement payment works through the PNI, I assume that there is a reduction in the amount of equalization payments for us, if you can just take us through mechanics of that and what the assumed in guidance that you mentioned, thanks.Sure Sera, and Good morning. First of all your question about HCB gene, as you know we don't break out our sales by product but as we've said before this products is not a significantly ...was not at its peak, a significant contributor to alliance sales financially but strategically we consider to be very important because it is a to our knowledge the only real time approach to HCB genotyping and while most of the testing today is performed on the AB 7000 or 7500 system, a version of the test has been developed for the end 2000 and we think that strategically will be very important going forward. I'll let Joe answer the second question.Yes Sarah, the actual settlement with Innogenetics between Abbott and Innogenetics is actually accounted for separately from the equalization payment. So it really doesn't have an impact on equalization and those cost a portion of that was taken in prior periods and the remainder is taken in this quarter and is reflected in the adjustments to the non-GAAP numbers.Okay and if you could just talk second about growth margin dynamics in the quarter, the cost of it did come in a little bit higher than what we had modeled if you could just talk about if there is anything unique in this quarter or such sort of the ebb and flow of the costs, thanks.We're not sure what you must notice that we can't reconcile that but the costs of goods are sort of consistent well it where we thought they would be.Okay and it was sequentially lower than last quarter though, was there anyIt fluctuates based upon shipments et cetera. I don't think you comparison quarter risks quarter is fairly meaningful in the business, to be honest with you.I don't think it's made for any material would been why there would be a shift. Can you --No it's impacted by shipments to Abbott it cost, obviously has an impact on that that the impact of the service business in this quarter would certainly have impacts on that. So again we don't really can really reconcile what you've modeled. But was it inline with our expectations.Okay thank you.And then next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin. You may proceed.Hi guys, you had a lot of income call as I might had miss something but the reason for the modest week down in the revenue forecast, what is the biggest distributor in that?Derik this is Cathy as you noted that we have narrowed on our guidance for revenue, and as your pointing out that narrowing is to the lower end of the revenues that we had projected earlier, and that's just our actually our realization of where we are. You have to note that the business is growing very-very rapidly and projecting exactly where it's going to hit is difficult. But the business is tracking our expectations and there is nothing specific to say.Okay I guess when you start looking out at all the thing you have in pipeline, and the growth opportunity there, once you get the spin done are you planning any sort of analyst meeting basically give us some more focus for the company and what are youSure, we have been talking about that, our current thinking is that we will schedule and analyst day shortly after the spin potentially right after Labor Day.I mean given that... looking at the periphery heart business and everything how is that potentially impacted at all by some of the consumer spending concerns that are going on I mean is it more of if you look hence doing public an adversities is have there been history of people going West to do that type of services in the past?I don't think so but I think I will ask Chris Hall [ph] to comment on that.This is something we dynamic we haven't seen traditionally there is been a couple of things that have underlined the business one is then that we are dealing secondary prevention heart disease patients so these are patients that have known disease, they have known issues and their doctors pushing them into the program and I think that dynamic insulates us a little bit from the consumer spending because I have and we have seen that traditionally because the doctors driving it in the context of disease just progressing. The second piece of the business is that most of these patients pay minimal or very little out of pocket. Medicare is covering most of or covering everything that we are doing at the patients of the secondary prevention patients we are increasingly getting into networks and the PPL patients are paying some $100 because of strong reimbursement across the board so I think with a relatively small out of pocket combined with the doctor pushing in it and it is these environments we haven't seen it and we are not really expecting to see that occur over the next few quarters.Great and Kathy there have been some concern about the ramp of the M2000 in the U.S. relative to the Europe. I mean how has that changed? Are you still seeing do you seeing better pick up now in United States?Abbott continues to do a great job in Europe Derik, the uptake of the M2000 in the United States particularly among the large customers has not been a strong as we would have liked to see.When you look at where your customers are in the same and what type of centers what type of places are buying the products?Well its all types of customers, there are hospitals and reference laboratories both are contributing to the growth here but we haven't penetrated the very large customers as affectively here in the United States as we would like to as I said before. On the other hand in Europe the spectrum of customers is all sizes; small, medium large. And so as we said today we are pleased with the performance of the M2000 the 450 placements is a very solid performance these customers on average continue to generate well over a $100,000 in revenue per year for us and so is this very important part of our portfolio.Okay thank you.And the next question comes from the line of Bruce Cranna from LeerinkSwann. You may proceed.Thanks good morning everyone. Kathy not so I don't want to press it too hard on this but I... the change in the top end of the guidance... is it fair to say you are little more conservative because of U.S. placement trends with M2000 or cystic fibrosis, you know may be even a little more than you thought previously?Well actually what we have done is just narrow the guidance. We have done this every year, actually where we start with a wider range and when we get to the fourth quarter we narrow it and in this particular case we narrowed it to the lower ends of the guidance that we had put out there previously but that's just reflecting how we think we are going to end the year.Okay so you wouldn't point necessarily at one of the other of those two things or maybe something else is being a little more disappointing in your portfolio?We just got three quarters of actuals down.I understand but so...So more accurate.But it is also what I said before, just to be clear about this, the revenue growth at Celera has been very, very strong and when you have a business with this much dynamic in it projecting exactly how you're going to come out 12 months in advanced or nine month in advanced is very difficult. If you look at the growth in our IBD business and the overall business it's great and we have just narrowed the guidance as I have done in previous years.Okay. And I guess in terms of KIF6 at Berkeley and the test marketing can you give us some senses I assume this is really I guess the pure expense for you at this point or can you actually generate some reimbursement from a sort of another code at this point or I guess I am getting a this kind of same thing as a prior question, it is a sort of a gross margin hit as you will KIF6 at Berkeley?I don't think so actually, what were earlier enough in the test market that we haven't got in a lot reimbursed testing, yes. But our expectation is that this is going to be reimbursed depending on whether it's private or Medicare somewhere between $80 and perhaps a $100 plus and that's a good reimbursement level for a service test. I'll ask Chris Hall [ph] to comment briefly on the uptake of KIF6 at Berkeley.We went and began to talk to a small subset of our clients about the test and all we have seen is a part of that is been a couple of dynamics one is been they have adopted it and we further along now in this launch because of how positively the message about KIF6 and integrating KIF6 under the disease was received then we have under the test that we have gone through this process with. The second piece of this the reception from the sales force is been high and we've got a lot of feed back from physicians that have heard about it, wanting to know wanting to know where we are in this whole market launch. So we've got in this quarter really positive feedback about the test and how its been conditioned. As Kathy said the other things and we are working on rest of this quarter is reimbursement in confirming where we are and been able to set pricing and the second piece is confirming clinically utility and how its being used use in the test market.Into that, that ASP or that reimbursement you are thinking about it, have you guys tampered that a little bit, or assume to remember we are kicking on to number last quarter.Now its consistent with what we said in the past, we've talked about the list price for this test to be slightly under $500 and that's consistent with other similar testing services and its very typical that the reimbursement is has that amount of differential versus the list price of the test.Okay, and then I guess last thing just the restructuring cost you booked related to BHL on the quarter or I guess that's my question is related to BHL on the quarter or were they somewhere else in the business?No the restructuring cost were not at BHL, there were some integration cost that we, the ongoing integration cost in the quarter, but the restructuring or the non GAAP adjustments for the quarter were actually on the IVD side of the business and cost related to external cost of preparing the company for this split from Applera.and also in proteomics, we basically as we said a few months ago have we focused on R&D effort around our current strategy with a heavy emphasis in the cardiovascular space now and have curtailed activities that are not supportive of this strategies that we outlined here today.Okay and then, Kathy, can you, I know this is tough, but can you give any sense as to when in France with HLA, can you size that for us at all?Well, as you know we don't break out of sales by product, but I can say that its million of dollars but not 10's of millions of dollars.Over the duration of the contract?Correct.Okay, thank you.And your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson from Thomas Weisel Partners. You may proceed.Kathy, what was the contribution from Berkley during the quarter, I missed that?The revenues were $22.6 million.That's the service business segment.Okay, and then both business is going to be break even by the end of the year?Peter we are not... we are not going to break out the actual profitability of the businesses at this point in time, we are still evaluating this segment reporting requirements that we have as a separate stand alone company but as part of Applera we're not going to break out business segment profitability.Okay, that's good to hear. But break even, is that going to be just of that EBIT or less alone just non-GAAP EPS levels.Our guidance is for non-GAAP EPS.Okay, did they should break even EBITDA as well?We are not... Peter, the guidance is for non-GAAP EPS at this Celera level.Okay, and then HPZ, when is it expected for the U.S.?We haven't projected for the U.S. the registration process, as you probably know in Europe, its pretty straight forward for a test like this and sites are being set up in Europe etc. and we are targeting for the first part our calendar 2009 to commercialize the assay in Europe.And I think you will target the U.S. eventually?We haven't made any announcements about our plans in the United States.Okay and was there any shares pull back during the quarter?No, no... we are not clear, we don't have a share repurchase program going back for Celera. The share repurchase program is for Applied Biosystems only.Okay, so the drop in share count was not related to any purchases by you?No.Okay, thank you.And the next question comes from the line of William Quirk from Piper Jaffray. You may proceed.Thanks, good morning rather. First question, can you help us think little bit about the pay or mix at Berkley Heart Lab, I am thinking largely going to Medicare versus health care.Sure, it's about 50% Medicare.50% of the Medicare?50% of the volume is Medicare. Obviously less than percentage wise is Medicare. The remaining balance is a mixture of private pay mostly out of network private reimbursement from the large insurance companies.Understood. Thanks very much. Secondly just thinking about the HPV product thank you, by the way for the color of that Kathy. Any plans or I should have you taken a license to subtype 52 to Kaigen and if you have not do you have any plans to do so?Typically wouldn't discuss pattern issues in that much detail but as I have said previously Celera and Abbott are very confident that we have freedom to operate under all of the necessary IP to sell this product as intended.Understood. And then lastly and then is it will be a bit of a nit picking question here but FDA is going to tighten the ASR rule in mid September of this year. Frankly it looks to us to be largely more of a logistics issue than anything else but certainly we would love to hear to comment I am not sure if there is any parts of I guess particular the added business I guess I am thinking the CFS assay in particular that, that might cause some problems?Well it could been have a problem for us with our CFS assay had we not gotten an FDA clearance on the product several months ago and so we are in the process of preparing to commercialize the FDA cleared product and intend to get to that completed within the next couple of months.And on the Berkeley side Kathy I assume that what you are going to do is just work with your existing vendors to basically separate the individual probesThe only ASRs that that I am aware of that are at the new at the HL in the April E area and my understanding is that third wave is doing what's necessary to be client.Very good, thank you.If there are no further question in the queue I will now turn the call over to Mr. Pevel Doctrin for closing remarks.Thank you all, for participating in the call today. A reminder that managements remarks will be posted within the hour on our website and the audio replay will be held at later today using the phone numbers listed in today's press releases. Thanks.Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This will conclude the presentation for today's conference. You may now disconnect.\",\n",

       "  '2008-01-25 04:00:06'): \"Good morning. My name is Mike and I will be your conference facility today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Applera Corporation second quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. During the speakers' presentations there will be multiple question-and-answer session periods. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to introduce Mr. Peter Dworkin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Applera Corporation. Mr. Dworkin, you may begin your conference.Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Applera management to discuss the second quarter fiscal 2008 financial results that we issued earlier this morning for Applera and its Applied Biosystems Group and Celera Group. As in previous earnings calls, this morning we will discuss both of our businesses separately starting with Applied Biosystems and then moving on to Celera. The Celera portion of the call will begin at 11:45 a.m Eastern Time and if the Applied Biosystems portion of the call should run beyond that time the Celera portion will follow immediately thereafter. Here with us today are Tony White, Chief Executive Officer of Applera, Dennis Winger, Chief Financial Officer of Applera and executives from the Applera operating businesses. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about Applera’s businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure and these are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in Applera's filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for both businesses. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials for Applied Biosystems can be found in today's press release and on the financial reports page of the investor relations section of the Applied Biosystems website at www.appliedBiosystems.com. Please note that after this call the text of these remarks we be posted on the Investor Relations section of the Applera website and on the separate Investor Relations section site of Applied Biosystems and Celera website. First, Tony White and Applied Biosystems President Mark Stevenson will comment on the performance of Applied Biosystems during the quarter. Also on the call today is Bill Craumer, IR Director for Applied Biosystems. Tony please.Good morning everyone. Applied Biosystems had a very good performance during the second fiscal quarter in terms of profitability on modest topline growth. I would characterize the business environment in the life science end markets as quite mixed right now; it is healthy in some segments and geographies and clearly challenging in others. We continue to see our business transitioning to a greater contribution from consumables, which grew 12% in the second quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. Instrument sales were essentially even with the prior year, affected by the transition going on in the DNA sequencing market to next-generation sequencing and by weakness in some mass spec markets. Our growing service business and our IP portfolio also contributed nicely to second quarter performance as revenues from other sources, principally the service business and from royalties, increased 10%. Geographically, we continue to see good strength in China and most other countries in our Asia Pacific region, led by spending in the applied markets and investments by pharma; weakness in Japan, where academic and pharma spending is tight and competition intense. Pretty good conditions overall in Europe, and a slower-growth environment in the U.S. Margin improvement is an important and ongoing performance metric for us and we are pleased to have expanded both gross margin and operating margins in the second quarter. The result was a very strong growth in EPS, 35% higher than last year's comparable quarter on a non-GAAP basis. The margin improvement is part of a long-term trend as we improve our cost structure through a variety of initiatives, take some of the benefits to the bottom line and redeploy other expenses to higher-growth parts of our business. However, we don’t regard the degree of improvement year-on-year in margins that we saw in the second quarter to be sustainable for the remainder of the fiscal year, due to some special factors in the second quarter that Dennis Winger will elaborate on in a few minutes. In this environment, our approach remains to seek the greatest possible topline growth by investing in higher growth opportunities both geographically and in terms of end market and customer applications, while delivering earnings growth at rates above the growth rates in revenues, through carefully expense management. Developing our talent is always a priority, and I want to reiterate how pleased the Board and I are at having promoted Mark Stevenson to President and Chief Operating Officer, completing our planned management transition for Applied Biosystems. Mark has done a great job over the past year. He is a strong leader, a strategic thinker and a tireless customer advocate. Equally important, he has the deep respect and support of the AB organization around the world. Before I ask Mark to report on the quarter in more detail, I will make a quick comment on the status of the Board’s re-evaluation of our corporate structure. As mentioned in the press releases today, it remains the preference of the Applera Board of Directors to unwind the Applera tracking stock structure and create separate publicly traded companies for Applied Biosystems and Celera. While the Board has not yet made a final decision on this matter we are working toward Applera filing a registration statement with the SEC during the current quarter in an effort to finalize a separation of the businesses by June 30th of 2008, which is the end of the current fiscal year. I’ll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark?Thanks, Tony. Before getting into specific product lines and platform discussion, I want to share with you some thoughts on where we’re going and what we’re doing to get there. Applied Biosystems has a proud heritage of developing innovative systems that have revolutionized the life sciences. Notwithstanding our history of success and market leadership, a few years ago Tony and the AB management team recognized that we had to develop growth strategies that more fully leveraged our proven product development skills and global footprint to ensure continued success. At the same time, we had to apply a more rigorous, strategic filter to our portfolio-building activities to ensure that new products and workflow solutions were addressing meaningful markets with a sufficient application focus while contributing appropriate financial returns. Let me give you an example of this process in action in the context of the genotyping market. A year ago, we had major gaps in our genotyping portfolio, in both the discovery and screening segments, and we were unable to support the market and benefit from its growth. Today, following our acquisition of Agencourt’s next-generation sequencing technology, we have leveraged our development skills to launch our SOLiD system, which we believe will become an important discovery tool. In November, we announced collaboration with Biotrove to develop and market an integrated workflow solution that deploys TaqMan genotyping assays on a mid-density array platform ideally suited to screening applications. Collectively, these two portfolio additions should allow us to access nearly $700 million of amenable new markets that we simply couldn’t serve before. Another good example is in the area of microRNAs, which increasingly are recognized as important factors in gene regulation and cellular function. Having integrated Ambion with our market leading real-time PCR platform and assays to build our consumables business, we have leveraged our consolidated know-how to develop a complete set of offerings enabling microRNA profiling, validation and characterization. Along with good portfolio management skills, the management group decided AB needed better operational discipline to strengthen gross and operating margins and drive profitability. Thanks to a range of initiatives, margins at AB have been improving since 2004 and, as you have seen from the second quarter results, we continue to make improvements in these areas. Dennis will discuss our financials more detail. So let me now walk you through the highlights of our product line performance. DNA sequencing continues to be in transition. CE instrument placements are declining in the research market as instrument funding priorities shift towards next-generation sequencing platforms. Related CE consumables volumes continued strong. CE placements in applied markets such as forensics tend to be lumpy, but we are seeing good pull-through on forensics kits which run on those platforms and which are reported in our Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics category. We began shipping commercial SOLiD units in October and are very pleased with the market’s strong interest in the product offering. As we have said before, we expected a few months delay between shipment and revenue recognition as customers get up and running on the systems and complete validation runs, and so our first revenue recognition on SOLiD system shipments will come in the current quarter which ends on March 31st. As we continue development of the SOLiD platform, our priority is to support existing customers and ensure system robustness at the world-class level AB customers have come to expect. As we ramp up this new technology, we are making sure that we allocate sufficient resources to deliver to this expectation. We are purposefully constraining shipments to new customers until we know we have trained field personnel to help start and validate these units. We are also at work on a number of planned improvements and new features in the system. We expect to incorporate these in shipments to be made later in this fiscal year. As with any new technology development, we are climbing an experience curve along with our customers. For those of you who have followed us for a while, you will recognize that this pattern is quite similar to that experienced by the ABI Prism 3700 CE system, which evolved to become the mainstay technology for the human genome sequencing project. Moving on to our non-sequencing business, the Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics category was both our largest at 36% of revenue and our fastest grower weighing in with 16% growth over the prior year quarter. Most of our consumables revenues are recorded in this category, including our Ambion products, TaqMan assays and real-time PCR master mixes for genotyping and gene expression. Consumables revenue for DNA forensics and other applied markets are also included. In addition to driving our consumables into key applications, we are enabling further growth and usage by deploying these technologies in what I would term different form factors. For example, at TaqMan assays and their gold-standard benefits are available in tubes, on microfluidic cards and soon, on Biotrove’s OpenArray nanofluidic platform for high sample-throughput screening applications. The OpenArray platform is expected to help us access the new and fast-growing market opportunity that is estimated at greater than $200 million. During the second quarter we launched an enhanced line of short interfering RNA products to turn off the gene expression of certain genes and study their role in biological pathways. We also signed an agreement with Integromics to integrate advanced data analysis capability into real-time PCR offerings for improved gene expression workflows. And in the forensics area, we introduced new software to automate workflows and analysis, catalyzing additional kit sales into forensic applications. The Mass Spectrometry product revenue category increased 1% compared to a tough comp in the prior year quarter, when revenue rose 14%. Our Applied markets mass spec business continued to show good growth, especially in North America and Asia. Japan has seen a significant market slow down in recent months, due to far more outsourcing and downsizing and in addition we have started a realignment of our organization there to more effectively deal with this new market dynamic. In the emerging markets, China is continuing to show strong growth. In Q2 we further strengthened our position in the rapidly growing Applied markets area with the introduction of our Cliquid Based MS system for forensic applications. This unique approach allows us to deliver high-performance systems in a range of price points while dramatically increasing the ease of learning and ease of routine use, especially needed in the applied markets where new customers don’t have extensive backgrounds in mass spectrometry. Overall we continue to see the mass spec market as one of the most competitive markets we participate in with both new and established players strengthening and broadening their offerings in both product types and application areas. As a market leader, we are committed to innovating in this market and are working closely with our partners at MDS Sciex to develop new applications and technologies to meet our customers’ needs. So in summary, our overall revenue growth in Q2 was in the mid-single digit range. We expect SOLiD systems to begin to contribute to DNA sequencing revenues in the current quarter and anticipate stronger results in the mass spectrometry product category this quarter and next. Our leadership in product development and global reach translates into winning strategies in markets and applications we chose to compete in. Looking ahead, we see opportunity for further improvement as we manage our new product pipeline more strategically, fine-tune our product mix, and inject further rigor and discipline into our operations. And now Dennis Winger will comment on Applied Biosystems’ financial results for the quarter.Thank you, Mark. As mentioned, improving margins was the highlight of the second quarter. Gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was 58.1% compared to 55.6% in the prior year quarter. Lower costs for enzymes used in a variety of our PCR consumables and the favorable impact of foreign currency were the primary factors causing the gross margin expansion. During the second quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 5% from the prior-year level, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency and employee-related costs. R&D expenditures decreased 13% in the second quarter from the prior year period, primarily due to lower employee-related costs, the termination in June 2007 of a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense and the timing of certain R&D project expenses. As Tony mentioned, some of the factors that benefited our margins during the second quarter are not expected to recur to the same extent in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. Currency, for example, was very favorable this quarter, but more recently the dollar has rallied modestly against the Euro and the Yen. We benefited more from product mix during the second quarter than we currently anticipate for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, due to reinvestment into strategic initiatives and timing of certain expenses, R&D and SG&A expenses were lower in the second quarter than we expect for the rest of the fiscal year. Second quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.50, an increase of approximately 35% compared to $0.37 in the prior year period. The net effect of foreign currency on fiscal 2008 second quarter EPS was a benefit of approximately $0.05 per share compared to the prior year period. The Group’s accelerated share repurchase transaction reduced quarterly per-share results by approximately two tenths of one cent. Speaking of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, I am pleased to say that Morgan Stanley has exercised its option to settle this transaction early. As a result, on Friday we will be receiving an additional 1.9 million shares of Applied Biosystems stock. This supplements the16 million shares we reported in October when we released Q1 financial results. Based upon this, we revised our estimate of the impact such that we now expect the accelerated share repurchase transaction to be accretive to Applied Biosystems fiscal 2008 earnings by approximately $0.02 per share, up from our previous estimate of $0.01. Subject to market conditions, we will now be able to consider open-market purchases of additional Applied Biosystems shares over the next several quarters, consistent with our previously stated intentions. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today’s press release as well as on the financial reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website, www.appliedbiosystems.com. Cash flow from continuing operations during the second quarter was strong at $128.8 million and capital expenditures were $10.6 million. At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $411 million, representing 53 days sales outstanding, and inventory was $157.3 million, representing 3.5 months of inventory on hand. As of the end of the second quarter, cash and short-term investments were $355.9 million, down from $494.5 million as of June 30th, 2007. This decrease was largely the result of a $602 million payment to Morgan Stanley for the accelerated share repurchase transaction, a portion of which was funded with available cash and the balance of which was funded by $270 million in short-term debt. We repaid $50 million of those borrowings during the quarter. Applied Biosystems has the following expectations regarding its financial performance for fiscal 2008. We expect mid-single digit revenue growth assuming current exchange rates. Revenues are expected to be comparable to the prior year level for [inaudible] increase for consumables. We anticipate growth across all product lines with the exception of other product lines, where we expect a decline. Quarterly year-over-year revenue changes may be different from our annual expectations due to a variety of factors, including the timing of customer orders and the disbursements of government funding. We expect gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 compared to the fiscal 2007 gross margin of [inaudible]. SG&A as a percent of total revenues is expected to be slightly higher than the prior year level of 28.3%. R&D as a percentage of total revenues is expected to be below the prior year level of 9.7%. We expect less quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in R&D and SG&A between quarters three and four than between quarters one and two. The average of R&D and SG&A as a percent of revenues in quarters one and two should be more informative about expense ratios for the remainder of the year than the ratios in either the first or second fiscal quarter alone. The Group expects an increase in operating margin in the fiscal 2008 of at least 200 basis points compared to the operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year, excluding special items in both fiscal years as described in the use of Non-GAAP financial information section listed below. We expect the effective annual tax rate used to calculate non-GAAP financial measures to be approximately 31%, compared to approximately 30% in fiscal 2007. We expect that…excluding the impact of currency, non-GAAP EPS will grow at double-digit rates. This includes the incremental impact of stock based compensation and the increase in the effective tax rate over the prior fiscal year. The total impact of these items on fiscal 2008 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.05 a share. The total pre-tax impact of FAS 123R, which is accounting for stock based compensation in fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately $22 million, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.08. Note that unlike some companies in our industry, we include stock-based expense in non-GAAP earnings. We expect capital spending to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. The Group believes this outlook and its fiscal year 2008 financial performance could be affected by a number of factors and other risks and uncertainties outlined in today’s press release and in our filings with the SEC. These comments reflect management’s current outlook. Applera does not have any current intention to update this outlook and plans to revisit the outlook for its businesses only once each quarter when financial results are announced. Thank you, and now we’ll be happy to take your questions about Applied Biosystems. Question and Answer[Operator Instructions ]. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the call. Wanted to dive a little bit more into some of the comments made about the international markets. In particular, Japan sounds like things have got a little bit worse there. So maybe, Tony, if you can give us a sense of how you view the outlook there for the coming year? And then also, Waters had talked about some softness in Eastern Europe earlier this week. So, I’m just wondering if you’re seeing anything there, too?Let me take those backwards. I guess I’m just not up-to-date on Eastern Europe, I don’t know if Mark or Laura can comment on that. Our business in Eastern Europe is not huge, so I’ll be surprised if it was something that would make much difference overall. I was in Russia recently and was impressed with how things seem to be starting to lift off over there, although it’s a tough market and it’s going to take a lot of positioning. I guess I sensed there was potential there that probably for the first time in a long time looks like it’s realizable in my lifetime. Japan has always been a tough market and I think lately we’ve seen always…the last five years have been a tough market, and lately we’ve seen…I think the most acute thing has been in the pharma markets over there, which has affected our mass spec demand. They seem to be moving out of Japan and into the China markets and other places for some of their CRO work and other things, and I think that this location has caused us some weakness in Japan. We’re seeing some of the corresponding pickup on the other side, as it goes to the other markets, which explains some of our growth rates. But I think we’ve also had some self-inflicted wounds in Japan. We’ve retooled our own operation over there and replaced a number of key people, I think people that are more savvy to the technology curve that we’re on. I think you no longer can have people that are just good generic managers in a market like that. You’ve got to have people that really have the technical knowledge in addition to that, and so we’ve upgraded that. Hopefully that will help us, but Japan is a tough market, and probably, as bad as a condition is right now and I would say… I think this is fairly temporary that we’ve seen in a while in terms of just raw demand for products. So, having said that, I think the management over there is pretty optimistic that things are going to come back. We’ll see, hope that’s helpful.Yes, yes, I know it is. And then just a follow-up on the mass spec business, I know you had a tougher comp this quarter. But can you give us a sense as to what the competitive dynamic is in the market now and where you stand with your product portfolio. Do you anticipate enhancing the portfolio in the near term?Well, Tycho, we don’t announce things before we announce them, so I can’t do that for you, but obviously, whenever you have harmonization of technologies, in other words, people catch up with your technical advances or get closer you have price competition. We’ve seen some of that, we haven’t introduced a platform in a while and I think that’s contributed some to the competitive nature. Plus, there’s just a lot more competitors. I mean, there’s a lot more people that are planning the space have moved into our…in the past that we’ve sort of had the high end to ourselves, more or less. I mean, I would…I think some of my creditors be offended by this statement. But we’ve been pretty good at that. But there are more competitors now. The range of…dynamic range of the competitors is stronger and it’s just a tougher market. We’re obviously aware of this and we’re ready to deal with it. I think the biggest issue; the big news for this quarter was the comp. Last quarter, we just had a very strong…this time last year we had a very strong quarter. It’s pretty hard to overcome that, I think that’s the biggest thing. Laura wants to make a comment, though, let her jump in.So, Tycho, obviously, as you well know, this is a very competitive business and we are seeing increased competitive pressure at the low-to-mid range of the market, there’s no doubt. Having said that, we still maintain a very strong position in the high end, the high performance end, which has always been our strength in the industry. And overall, we continue to maintain our leadership position in this market. But there’s no doubt that competitors, particularly in the low-to-mid range, there is many more of them, and they’re all kind of targeting the same areas, particularly in the applied markets application areas.Okay. Thank you very much, that is helpful.And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with UBS. Please proceed.Good morning.Good morning, Derik.You know, looking at the…going to the mass spec comments, you’ve mentioned some potential funding delays in Europe, can you shed some light on that?I didn’t mention it, so I’ll let Laura do it.Hi, Derik, it’s Laura Lauman. There has been some softening in Europe although it’s certainly not at the level that we’ve seen in Japan, particularly in the academic area and much less so in pharma. Overall, really where the softening in the business has happened is in Japan, and it’s primarily based around…the majority of it is pharma market, as Tony mentioned, but also in the academic and applied markets as well.Okay, when you actually do look at the global pharma markets, I mean can you just give us a little bit of your feeling on how you see this current environment shaping out this year. I mean, I know U.S. pharma is mixed, if you could give us your big picture view on, so we can know how you are modeling that market?I think overall, the pharma industry is mixed right now. I think there’s some strength in North America, certainly in China, although the market dynamics is very different there. As I mentioned, I think Japan, there’s clearly weakness there and I think Europe overall is solid. So globally, I would say it’s a mixed environment.Do you think that as…and particularly here in the US, do you think that as the election is closer during this year. Do you potentially see some funding changes in terms of average spending? What are your view as pharmacologists [ph].They’re both looking at me like do we have to answer that? We don’t know, we could sit here and take up everybody’s time with…you guys really don’t know, do you?No idea, Derik.I don’t see it changing, Derik, I think it’s going to be in North America right now.Well, I mean that’s what our surveys would suggest, but I mean you guys are at the forefront there, so I just thought I would ask.Yes, no, thank you.So, I guess could you just give us some updates on SOLiD and, I guess what the feedback has been initially from the customers. I mean, can you give us any feel on the throughputs and what’s out there. I mean, obviously the Street’s doing their channel checks, we’ve had some feel for what’s out there, we are hearing things about two to four-gig performance on this on average. Could you just give us a little bit more details on what’s going on?Yes, Derik. So, the feedback has been very good from the customers around the world that we’ve been in [inaudible]. I mean the things we’ve been focused on the throughput, they’re particularly pleased with, and the accuracy they’re seeing, we see…when you’re going on to do some of these cancer type work, the accuracy is very important, we’re seeing that get [ph]. One of the areas they’ve also seen is this mate-pair analysis that we can do, that just the distance between the mate-pairs is one of the key things that’s coming back from the Group, and it’s very important. They expect a lot, as I said, in the call and it is created from our robustness and we’re delivering on that where we’re focused on supporting the customers. It’s for ours and them learning how to handle this amount of data, how to process it, how to generate and then present it. And so you’ll see some of their presentations coming at the scientific meetings during the year, as customers start to present some of their findings that they’re getting using our new systems.And if you look at this year, do you expect to introduce some automation for the front end, I mean what are you doing to help simplify that?We’re continuing to focus on all the steps across it. So, you’ll see workflow improvements. The first version you always come out, get it out, and focus on the role throughput and some of the capabilities. You’ll see some improvements in the run-time coming through, and how the automation comes through, and so that’s all in the plan as we roll this out during the year.Great, thank you, I’ll get back in line.And the next question comes from line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.Hi, good morning. You made a comment that the CE consumable continues to be good. Have you gotten any kind of feedback from some of the customers that have adopted other next-gen sequencing platforms and what the usage is on their current CE instrumentsYes, we have, and I think the market remains very dynamic. I think a year back a lot of people as they started to adopt the technology would have predicted much faster decline in some of their usage of CE systems and associated consumables and some of the high-throughput customers. We continue to predict that, while we would see decline in the instruments, we would still see usage in the CE systems, and we’re actually seeing that in some of our customers. So, even some of the high-throughput systems while they’re decommissioning some of their CE based systems they continue to use CE for many of the different applications, which was as we predicted. So, again the sort of funding priority shifted to…people want to try new technology, but then when they also want to follow up, do some finishing work, some framing on the genomes, they’re using capillary electrophoresis a lot in that. Plus, you then see the smaller labs that have projects. While there’s capacity of instruments out there on CE, so we’re not seeing a demand and growth for the new CE based sort of instruments. We do see continued use of the consumables, and that’s why you saw a very modest growth this quarter.I would just add that, it depends on the market segment where you’re going to see different levels of transition. In the very high-throughput genome centers, which used to be a very big part of our business and now are not as much, we think the transition there over time will be more dramatic because the applications that they have are strictly high-throughput applications where the new technology is a pretty good fit for what they want to do. So, over time I would think that would be a pretty radical change. I don’t think it will happen overnight, but over years. In the smaller labs, we think that there are enough applications for CE, where CE really is the technology of choice, that while they may take up and create new applications with next gen, they’re going to keep the CE machines running. And so we’re seeing by segment very different behavior and predictive behavior on the parts of the customers. The net effect for us is that we think the consumables and service string on the instruments overall in the placements that are out there, you have to bear in mind that the 30…130 machines, the mid-range machines, really aren’t threatened by next-generation sequencing at all. It’s going to go on for a long time and we’re fairly comfortable with that prediction.Thank you for that. And then with respect to your strategy of going into this medium multiplexing segment, do you see that it is opening up a new market or do you see it kind of taking from the micro arrays and from the single…the 96 well technologies as part of that $700 million, or do you see that as opening up new opportunities outside of those two areas?It opens up for us the new markets that are…many are follow-on studies to the initial discovery work. So, while people are discovering variations in the genome and more variation than we originally expected using tools like SOLiD, what we’re seeing is then a proliferation of downstream experiments in different applications. And what it allows us to do is take the different formats of TaqMan Assays that we have in this range of genotyping into these different, it’s physical multiplexing, but different form factors, and so you got the benefits of the TagMan chemistry but also then deployed into different factors in like a low-density array, the TagMan array we have, but also into these BioTrobe 3000 Assay. So for us it’s a new market in applications, but otherwise we’ve tried to go to with arrays and that’s where we’re targeting.Thanks. And then Dennis, couple of financial questions. With respect to that gross margin guidance, does that include the impact of FX that you saw in the first half of the fiscal year?Yes, it does.All right, thanks. And then, with respect to the share count, what do you think that you’ll end the year with share count now that, once you get that extra one point…the extra shares?Yes. I don’t have an answer for that, we’ve obviously brought in around 17.9 million shares total as part of the ASR, we’ve bought in $100 million more of shares prior to that. So, we’ve got approximately $500 million to go to complete the 1.2 billion that we announced.I’ll ask another way. The 16 million shares, did you see the full impact of that in the share count in the second quarter, or was that kind of averaged out?No, it averages out.All right thanks. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.And the next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Merrill Lynch please proceed.Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a good margin expansion. Just a couple questions, Tony, you mentioned upfront that you know the market was mixed, we heard on another call that the budget flush wasn’t as strong as maybe they had hoped for. Did you get a sense for that? For those companies that you kind of have their fiscal year ending at, in the calendar year, that the budget flush maybe wasn’t quite as strong as it’s been in the past?I can take that one, if that’s okay, Tony. We didn’t see the year-end funding that sometimes is anticipated in the November/December time frame. It was pretty much flat with what we saw from last year.And was that also across the board outside of mass spec as well, Mark, could you say or--?He’s talking about like--.Don’t have much of that.The pharma mainly comes into the mass spec in the instrument side, and when you look at our pharma business as sort of from…sort of DNA side, a lot of it is the gene expression and [inaudible] consumables. So, it’s less impacted by the sort of year-end capital purchases that you see with large equipment like the mass spectrometry, and some of the larger equipment is more…and we are more in place by the academic…or other trends like in the U.S. we saw, unusually the DNA forensics area, the Debbie Smith, the Justice for All Act in the U.S. was fully funded this year, which was surprising to us, [inaudible] a couple of years when it got cut down. So, there is sort of various end markets that we’ve had to serve in some of the other areas.Okay, thanks. And then…you also mentioned, though, that you have been stronger, obviously, in the high end and there’s a lot of competition coming in at the low end, maybe trying to move its way up. But how would fast would you just say that high-end mass spec market is growing overall, as people kind of trade share [ph] and leapfrog each other with new instruments. Do you see that as still growing, or do you see the growth rate slowing down in that high-end market?I think the high-end mass spec market is still a very solid market. We are still the leader in that space, and there is no one that can compete at the same level as Applied Biosystems from a performance perspective. So that continues to be a very solid market for us.You don’t think the overall market is slowing at all, at that high end?I don’t, I think it’s remaining consistent there. I mean, pharma is ebbing and flowing, as I outlined earlier, from a geographic perspective, but overall the market in that area and primarily the DMPK areas remain solid.Okay. And then, Dennis, last question for you. If you could…could you quantify this particular quarter, I know you mentioned that FX had a $0.05 benefit to the earnings per share line, but could you quantify just from a gross margin perspective what impact FX had? And also, I think you, Tony mentioned that you had greater royalties than you maybe had been expecting or at least had had in the past, and what impact that had on gross margins to get a sense as to what a more realistic run rate would be?FX was about 0.8% for the quarter on gross margins, so not a terribly large impact.Okay, great, thanks.And the next question comes from the line of Michael Cherney [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Hi, guys, a lot of my questions have already been asked, but I just wanted to touch a little bit more on the applied markets. You said you saw a lot of strength there during the quarter and particularly point to forensics. Can you talk a little about the food and safety testing and some of the environmental markets you guys are going after?Yes, I can talk a little about that, Michael. I think it falls into two areas. In both of our applied market areas, we are targeting leveraging our existing technology into those areas, and it sort of play out in different ways, in different ways around the world. So, we continue to see strong presence in leveraging our mass spectrometry into food testing and environmental testing, particularly that’s being historically internationally, but also now increasingly here in the U.S., we’ve seen that growth. We’ve continued to target it by, as I said, making easy to use applications that take the basic mass spectrometry technology and as we launch this quarter take it into applications like forensic or food with the Cliquid system. The areas on the DNA side that we have seen continued strong growth is actually leveraging the DNA side into some of the pharmaceutical manufacturing area, particularly using a micro [ph] system that runs on CE-based sequences testing for microbial contaminants in biological drugs. And since there’s an increasing presence of biologics coming through the pharma pipeline, we see that need for increased testing. So, that’s one of the areas sort of on the DNA side that we’ve seen increasingly strengthen.Great, thanks. Everything else was already asked.And our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.Tony, I wonder if you could talk more about the problems in Japan. How quickly do you think that could turned around and has that been a slow-rising problem or did it just hit this quarter?Well, I wish I really knew how long it takes to do anything in Japan. I mean I’m always struggling whenever I’m over there and doing the things about that sort of thing. It’s been a chronic area of difficulty for us now for a few years. I think the two contributing factors to that have been, one, the external aspects, the marketplace has been far more moribund than it had been in previous years. It’s been more difficult. Our positioning, where the research dollars were going versus where our products were positioned was not particularly favorable to us, or a lot of the life science companies for that matter. So, it’s been a difficult market. And I think the other part of the problem has been self-inflicted wounds. I don’t think we had the right management lineup in many areas over there and that’s been, as you know, it takes a while to deal with those things, we’ve done that now, but how long it takes to get traction is difficult. This past quarter, though, was probably more acute than we’ve seen and that the…and I think other people reported this too, the mass spec market was much more difficult than we’ve seen. What little business was there was very competitive, more at the low end than at the high end, which doesn’t favor our mix, more in the applied markets than any place else, which was really basic applications that doesn’t favor our product line. So, how long that’s going to last, I don’t know. Obviously, we are running full speed to see what we can do on our end to try to correct anything that we have control over, but I can’t make predictions about the market. For what it’s worth, the local management is fairly upbeat about their prospects for the…let’s say, the next year or so, but I wait to be convinced by the facts.Thank you, Tony, that was really helpful. And then on the outsourcing sort of theme that’s developing how is that changing the marketplace and sort of ABI’s approach to outsourcing? Is that more concentration on reagents and more concern about placing boxes?Are you talking about outsourcing of CROs?Yes.Well, outsourcing, I think, is code for people who are moving overseas to less expensive markets, the way I would see it. I think pharma companies have been outsourcing in the more developed markets for a long time, so I don’t think that’s a new trend. I think the movement to these earlier stage markets, third world countries or developing markets, or however you want to characterize it, is picking up and we’ve…that [inaudible] on us. We’ve been investing as about as heavily and as aggressively as we know how in these markets to get a footprint there so that we can intercept these customers when they emerge. We’ve done a reasonably good job at that, but like any new market, there is a lot of dislocation, there is a lot of customers that aren’t very experienced on how to buy and what to buy and they fall for a lot of…some companies will just airmail products to them and not support them. We’ve taken the approach that if we’re going to go into a market, we try to plan to be there a long time and have happy customers, so we put resources on the ground to train them and service them before we sell the instrument. And I think that’s starting to pay off for us now, I think our sales growth in these markets is pretty solid. I hope that’s helpful, but the thing it’s different, I think, is this concentration on the emerging markets seems to be more acute, but it’s also resulting in slower growth in the more developed markets.Do you have enough infrastructure in place in Asia, et cetera to sort of cope with that outsourcing in emerging markets and the applied markets growing?Yes, I think so. You can always do more, but I would say we are proportionate to the opportunity right now, we’ve been out in front of it and our presence in China, in particular, has really gone up dramatically in the last year, year-and-a-half. India, we have a great partner over there, and so our infrastructure is already in place there, but I think we can do more to prepare for the future. Brazil is an area where I think we need to get a little more and gear down there, although we have good…we have a good infrastructure, good management team, I think the market is going to move more there in the future, and we need to be a little more attentive to that, but pretty good start. So, we’ve talked about this a long time, this is not a new idea. We’ve been focused on these markets now for a while, and we’ve made painful investments sometimes, putting expenses on the ground when you don’t have the revenues to support them upfront is a difficult decision, but we’ve been doing it, and I think we’re happy we did.Okay, thank you so much.Sure.And our next question comes from the line of John Sullivan with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, Mark, can you just take us through briefly what sort of applications are being mentioned most frequently by those scientists expressing interest in SOLiD?Yes, John, I would say there are two main themes going on at the moment, one is in this area of sequencing, thousands of people and their genomes and doing that structure analysis of the genome, which turns out to be much greater, so people doing, looking for that structural variant work, particularly, taking this mate-pair approach to look for deletions, insertions, long repeat sequences, and that’s one of the key applications. The second is just using the raw capacity in gene expression, so we’re seeing increasingly people study transcript levels that you can see on a TaqMan assay and so you knew was there, but you couldn’t when you tried to do a global survey on an array. And so we’re seeing some very interesting data coming through on the gene expression area combining this capacity we’ve got in the…just the raw material part with our gene expression applications. So, those are the two main themes we are hearing back from our customers.Okay, great. And then shifting gears for a second, can you give us a sense of the timeline and the hurdles that have to be overcome to include BioTrove-based products in your product offerings?So, it’s really making the whole flow easier. So we’re working through, I mean, BioTrove, we have some early-access customers out, and what we’d like to do is have it as easy it is for the customer today to go on to our website or to a TaqMan array and download that. So, it’s getting the logistics working between the two organizations, validating those assays, and we are working through all of those logistics. So, it’s very seamless for a customer to come on board, order those assays and then get AB-level support with the system. We expect here in the mid of this calendar year to start coming out with full commercialization from that system and we will continue to have some early access programs both here in the U.S. and internationally as we launch it.Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.And the next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with First Analysis. Please proceed.Hi, first question for Dennis on the gross margin. Dennis, when do you expect the benefits from the lower enzyme costs to anniversary?Well, they’ve been in effect now for about a year. We’ve been phasing it in over the course of the last 12 months.I guess some of it has anniversaried.Yes, some of it has anniversaried. That’s correct.But I guess, are the costs continuing to come down, or did they come down in one shot?They will still get a little bit of benefit going forward as we do more in-house manufacturing.When you talk about mix being a factor behind your gross margin improvement are we talking about mix between royalties and products or are there dramatic margin differences between products?There is not dramatic margins here between products, but there are margin differences between products. And clearly the mass spec line as an example has lower gross margins for us because we share half the profits with our partners. But there is difference in the margins, but they’re not great differences in margins.Okay. And then finally, why did you reduce your capital spending forecast by 10 million?Well [inaudible], we’re not going to spend it. We’re analyzing an expansion of budget and we haven’t moved forward on it yet. So that’s one of the factors.Okay. Thank you.And our last question for this Q&A session comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the upcoming AGBT and some of the other conferences that are on the calendar. Do you think that any of your customers or potential customers are holding off in advance of data presentations before moving forward with SOLiD? And would you expect data presented at AGBT specifically to have some material impact on the pace of placements?Well, we’re looking forward to AGBT. So, we’re going to be holding our two-hour customary symposium on February 7th. During the meeting, users will be presenting solid data and we expect also during the conference sessions, we, and others and customers will be presenting data. For us AGBT is just one of a series of conferences. So, while some people will use that conference to get their information, we are seeing huge amounts of interest around and we are presenting data not just at that conference, but conferences internationally around the world. So, then…it’s not sort of such a gating item that everyone’s pausing, it’s not yet to the statement like an ASMS in mass spec. It’ll just be one data point amongst a series of conferences going on.And the pace of placements is not driven by demand, it’s driven by our sense of how quickly we can place these things and get them properly serviced and the same reason I plug and play machines, thoroughly staged technology and so the pace of placements is on our side, not the demand side.Okay, thanks that’s helpful. And just one follow-up on a comment you made in response to an earlier question. I mean, clearly we’ve talked a lot about mass spec and how the outlook for that business also translates into your outlook for overall instrumentation sales. Clearly there is some broader commentary you’ve made on weakness in other areas of instrumentation. Specifically if I look at CE placements, is it fair to assume that where you guys are seeing the most weakness is in the 3730xl and 3730s and not in lower throughput instrumentation?Yes, that’s to say, I mean as we predicted and also Tony commented today, it is also by market segment, so we predicted a decline in the research segment, which we’re seeing. The 3730s was already a fairly small portion since they were mainly the high-throughput customers. But the 3110s we expect will continue to see demand in smaller labs and research, in the clinical labs that we sell too, as well as into some of the applied markets like the forensic and pharma manufacturing.I think the biggest issue in growth on the 3130 last time I looked was…which is the mid-range estimates, we just placed a boatload of them last year to new forensics labs around the world. And so the comp on that is really pretty tough. The underlying research demand, I think, has been fairly constant. But we did place a lot of machines last year. Hopefully now we’ll get those forensics labs up and running and we’ll see the corresponding throughput from the reagents. So, you’re right, the 3730 is the issue. Doug Schenkel – Cowen and Company Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dworkin for the Celera portion of the earnings call. Mr. Dworkin, you may begin.This is Tony. But before we start the Celera piece, I just had a comment about the results that I think didn’t get addressed in the questions. I’ve been reading…scanning some of the first calls this morning. A couple of comments were made about the spending in R&D. And let me put that in perspective. We have worked very hard to review the strategic developments of all of our R&D spending and we have been streamlining that for a while. You see the effect of that in the results and in the level of spending as a percent of sales. No one should confuse that though with starting the R&D pipeline for short-term results. Anybody that’s followed our company a long time knows we just don’t do that, we couldn’t get away with that internally if we wanted to. So, these are our refocusing of R&D spending that makes a lot of sense, is actually going to increase our productivity in R&D and we have pretty solid support throughout the organization for these changes. There also are timing issues in there. Sometimes R&D isn’t all people costs on board. There are external spending and so forth, and we had…however you want to characterize it, we had particularly good timing this quarter and we’ve got a little more savings out of it. So, I just want to make that comment. Overall, we think we had a good quarter. We had a very good earnings quarter. Last time I looked one of the big things a management team is supposed to do is make money for the shareholders and we made a lot of that this quarter, and we didn’t do it by selling out our future. We’ve cut SG&A spending so that we have the resources to go out and invest in these new hopefully higher-growth markets without it being incremental to the overall base, and that’s a hard thing to do, we’ve accomplished that. Anytime you have modest revenue growth you are always in danger of your expenses overrunning you. We’ve been able to avoid that. And in terms of our revenue growth, if you look in the details, we have a lot of product lines that are outgrowing the competitors pretty dramatically. Many of our product lines are double-digit growth product lines. We have one that’s in transition that makes the overall net effect less dramatic, but overall I think the spending and cost initiatives that we’ve had match the strategy and match the realities of where we are in this transition. Thanks.So with that, we’ll move to the second half of our call today, the Celera portion. Tony will make some introductory remarks about Celera and then Celera President, Kathy Ordoñez, will review the Celera business. Also on the call today for the Q&A portion are other Celera and Berkeley HeartLab executives, as well as David Speechly, Celera’s Senior Director of Investor Relations. And for those who may have just joined this morning. Please note that during the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the company’s businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure that are referred to in the releases issued this morning, and in Applera’s filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for Celera. These are not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. And a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials for Celera can be found in today’s press release and on the Financial Reports Page of the Investor Relations section of the Celera website at www.celera.com. Tony?Thank you, Peter. For those you who just joined Good morning. Celera has made substantial progress this quarter. We saw improved performance of our products within the alliance with Abbott, and I am encouraged with the collective contribution from Berkeley HeartLab and Atria Genetics to the Celera financial profile. This outcome was what we had anticipated when we considered the acquisitions of these companies. With these overall developments and combined with the organizational focus that Kathy Ordoñez and her management team are implementing to further streamline the business, we’re confident that this progress is going to continue. As mentioned in the press releases today, it remains the preference of the Applera Board of Directors to unwind the Applera tracking stock structure and create separate publicly traded companies for Applied Biosystems and Celera. While the Board has not yet made a final decision on this matter, we are working toward filing a registration statement with the SEC during the current quarter in an effort to finalize the separation of the businesses by June 30th, 2008, the end of the current fiscal year. I’ll now hand it over to Kathy who will discuss Celera in more detail.Thank you Tony and good morning everyone. This has been a productive period for us with a number of positive developments. We completed the acquisitions of BHL and Atria Genetics, and the integration of these businesses into Celera is proceeding well. Our scientists continued to publish their discoveries in peer-reviewed journals, and I’ll expand on the KIF6 publications from earlier this week in a few minutes. Our pharmacogenomics program gained additional traction with a collaboration with the French pharmaceutical company Ipsen in growth failure. And finally, as Tony mentioned, we’re pleased with the overall performance of the business this quarter. Over the past few quarters we have spoken about our focus on two core strategic objectives. First, to continue our delivery of products and services that support personalized disease management. And second to position Celera to have more autonomy and direct access to customers outside the alliance with Abbott. We feel that we are making good headway toward the achievement of both of these objectives. With the acquisitions of BHL and Atria behind us, we have restructured the organization around two business units. Our in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, product business that incorporates the alliance with Abbott and our laboratory testing and disease management services business through BHL. In order to facilitate the integration of BHL and Atria and prepare for the potential separation of Celera from Applera Corporation, we’ve consolidated our IVD product business under the leadership of Dr. Mike Zoccoli, who was promoted to the position of General Manager of this business. Mike joined Celera six years ago and has a wealth of experience in diagnostic product development and manufacturing. The BHL service business continues under the leadership of Frank Ruderman. In line with these structural changes, and as previously noted, we are rebalancing our R&D investments by shifting some funding from discovery to development and concentrating much of our discovery effort in the cardiovascular space. We have also curtailed our proteomics-based therapeutic target discovery and validation activities, while continuing to fund diagnostic proteomics-based work. I’d like to talk about the BHL part of our business for a moment. BHL’s business model is based on personalizing cardiovascular disease management for prevention of disease in higher risk and secondary care patients. BHL employs just over 300 people, with nearly a third of these in the field, either as sales representatives or clinical educators. Our clinical educators work with medical practitioners as they incorporate results from BHL’s cardiovascular tests to develop and monitor the effectiveness of personalized treatment regimens for exercise, nutrition, stress reduction and therapy compliance for their patients. BHL has a strong history of bringing new tests to the cardiovascular market, including recent successful introductions of the Lp-PLA2 and NT-pro-BNP tests. We are looking to this capability to commercialize new laboratory developed tests at BHL that incorporate Celera’s research findings. During calendar 2007, service revenues generated by BHL grew to approximately $85 million, consistent with the forecast we made at the time of the acquisition, and reflecting a 16% increase over calendar 2006. During 2007, nearly 4,200 physicians ordered more than 1.8 million tests from over 227,000 patient samples processed by the laboratory. Earlier this week, Celera and 39 collaborators published three research articles in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. This work involved collaborators from 18 institutions, including Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, University of Glasgow in Scotland, University of San Francisco, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, just to name a few. The papers describe the identification of a novel gene variant called KIF6 that codes for a kinesin-like protein that conveys up to 55% increased risk for coronary events versus people who do not have the risk form of the gene. KIF6 is prevalent in about 60% of the population. The KIF6 risk allele provides a similar degree of risk for coronary heart disease as an elevated level of LDL cholesterol or hypertension. We think it’s important for a person to know their KIF6 status and if they’re exposed to this incremental genetic risk. Two key findings of these papers were that the excess risk for cardiovascular events associated with the KIF6 variant was virtually eliminated by pravastatin, or Pravachol, therapy and that high-dose atorvastatin or Lipitor therapy reduced risk in carriers of the KIF6 risk variant more effectively than moderate-dose pravastatin therapy in acute coronary syndrome patients. Since carriers of the KIF6 risk allele benefited from both Pravachol and Lipitor, we believe this to be a class effect. These findings make a compelling case for testing for KIF6 status to aid in the medical assessment of the substantial number of people considered to be at moderate risk of developing heart disease based on traditional risk factors such as cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Moreover, knowledge that the elevation in heart disease risk conveyed by the KIF6 genetic variant can be virtually eliminated by statin therapy may provide physicians with new genetic information in considering treatment options for their patients. It also supports long-term statin therapy compliance among patients carrying the KIF6 risk variant. With this in mind, BHL is in the process of validating a laboratory-developed test for KIF6, which we expect to commercialize in the coming months. Celera’s IVD product business also expects to develop and secure registration for a diagnostic product to identify patients with the KIF6 risk variant. This is the first in a series of new cardiovascular tests in development, including tests that identify people who benefit from aspirin therapy and others that identify those people at elevated risk for stroke, early MI, and thrombosis. In our breast cancer program, we are pleased that LabCorp commenced the commercialization of the first of two assays based on Celera’s discoveries. This breast cancer assay is a gene expression panel that is expected to more accurately determine estrogen and progesterone receptor status than commonly employed immunohistochemical methods. Some of you may have read the article a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal that highlighted some of the inaccuracies of such commonly employed breast cancer tests. We believe a gene expression approach is a more accurate means of assessing ER/PR status. Another laboratory developed test that predicts the potential for breast cancer metastasis incorporating Celera discoveries is also currently in validation at LabCorp. We are planning to develop and seek registration for a test on the m2000 real time system that incorporates these findings. On that note, I’d like to take a moment to discuss end-user sales of products that are part of our strategic alliance with Abbott, which is an important component of our IVD product business. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, total end-user alliance sales were $32.0 million compared to $23.2 million in the prior year quarter. We were encouraged with the sustained penetration of the m2000 system in its existing markets in this last quarter, and this system continues to contribute substantially to the growth in alliance end-user sales. We also saw increased sales of the Atria HLA products and ViroSeq tests for genotyping HIV, which also contributed to the year-over-year growth in end-user alliance revenues. These increased sales were partially offset by lower sales of cystic fibrosis reagents and the removal of the HCV genotyping ASRs due to the injunction against sales of these products by Abbott previously issued in the Innogenetics litigation. Last week, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated this permanent injunction and remanded the case back to the lower court for further action. In summary, we had a productive second quarter with important publications and solid financial performance. We’re encouraged by the integration of BHL and Atria into Celera and with the consequent expansion of revenues from these sources, as well as the performance of our IVD product business. With all the developments over the past quarter, Celera is better focused and prepared to deliver on the promise of personalized disease management through its diagnostic product and service offerings, with a strong business profile for the future. Now, Dennis Winger will make a few comments regarding the financial results for Celera and our financial outlook for fiscal 2008.Thank you, Kathy. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, Celera reported a net profit of approximately $300,000, or essentially break-even earnings per share, due to factors outlined in today’s press release, compared to a net loss of $500,000, or $0.01 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Reported revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were $40.3 million, compared to $13.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Excluding revenues that were derived from services and products related to the BHL and Atria acquisitions, Celera’s reported revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 increased $3.4 million compared with the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily related to higher diagnostics related licensing and royalty revenues and a higher equalization payment from Abbott. The second quarter of fiscal 2007 included $2.5 million from the sale of a small molecule drug discovery and development program. In the recent quarter, R&D expenses decreased by $1.4 million compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to reduced spending in proteomics discovery efforts. SG&A expenses increased by $12.8 million in this last quarter compared to the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting increased expenditures relating to sales of BHL services and increased expenses related to the review of Applera’s corporate structure. Celera ended the recent quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $342 million, down about $206 million in the quarter. The level of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2008 reflects the completion of the acquisitions of BHL and Atria Genetics in the quarter, which collectively consumed approximately $215 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. The guidance that we can provide for Celera for fiscal 2008 is as follows. Total reported revenues are anticipated to be $135 million to $145 million. Reported R&D expenses are anticipated to be $40 million to $45 million, and SG&A expenses are anticipated to be $70 million to $75 million. Celera anticipates that it will be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for fiscal 2008, although non-GAAP earnings may be below break-even for the third quarter due to, among other things, ongoing integration expenses from the Berkeley HeartLab and Atria Genetics acquisitions and costs incurred in support of the anticipated separation of Celera from Applera Corporation. Amortization of intangibles relating to acquisitions, which are excluded in the determination of non-GAAP earnings per share, are expected to be approximately $0.06 per share for the fiscal year, of which approximately $0.04 per share are expected to be incurred in the last six months of the fiscal year. The total pre-tax impact of FAS 123R in fiscal 2008, which is stock-based compensation expense, is expected to be approximately $7 million, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.06. Note that unlike some other companies in our industry, we include net stock option expense in non-GAAP earnings. Celera currently anticipates it will end the fiscal year with $340 million to $350 million in cash and short-term investments. The Group believes this outlook and its financial performance could be affected by a number of factors and other risks and uncertainties outlined in today’s press release and in our filings with the SEC. These comments reflect management’s current outlook. Applera does not have any current intention to update this outlook and plans to revisit the outlook for its businesses only once each quarter when financial results are announced. We will now be happy to take your questions regarding Celera. Question and Answer[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of William Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.Great. Thanks, good morning. First question is, it looks like gross margin for Berkeley is tracking north of 60%. Is that a good assumption, one. I guess, then secondly, is that a good assumption to think about it going forward?We haven’t disclosed the gross margin for Berkeley, and we’re currently not breaking that out as a segment on that on revenue line.Understood Dennis. Secondly, just thinking about the year-over-year increase in equalization payments, obviously, I’m not necessarily going to ask you to disclose that, it’ll be in the financials. But just, Kathy, directionally, was this up about 60% or so year-over-year, is that a good ballpark number?Actually, the phone cut out. Could you repeat your question?Sorry, Kathy. So, the question is, the math would suggest that equalization payment was up roughly 60% year-over-year, and I know you don’t want to get too fine of a point on that just yet, but am I in the ballpark?Bill, the number, if you’re asking the number, is 4.8 million on the quarter.Perfect.And that compares to 2.7 million in the prior-year second quarter.Good. So, clearly we are seeing some positive leverage here in the Abbott alliance. I know this has obviously been part of the plan all year. Would it be safe to say that we’ve kind of passed the turning point here? Should we expect to see this leverage accelerate based on our new revenue run rate, or how should we think about that?Well, if you’ve been following the performance of the Abbott alliance over the last two years or so, the sales I would characterize as lumpy. We have strong quarters, and then, weaker quarters. You’ll recall last quarter for example was a weaker quarter, and we had a very nice quarter this quarter. And I would expect that this trend of inconsistent sales from quarter to quarter would continue. It’s partially driven by large tender placements of m2000 and large reagent orders of tests like ViroSeq. So, I think the trend is going clearly in the right direction, but you can’t extrapolate directly from this very strong quarter.Understood. That’s very helpful, Kathy. And then the last question and I hope it’s not really too early to talk about ASPs for the KIF6 test, but any guidance here would obviously be very much appreciated.So, it’s…we have not launched the test yet at Berkeley HeartLab. We have modeled the test entry on the order of $2 to $500, but we are still collecting market research and would expect to finalize that just as we go into commercialization. What I can say though is that we are committed to making sure that the price of this test is in hundreds of dollars, not thousands of dollars.Understood. Thank you very much.And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Cranna with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.Thanks, good morning everyone. Kathy, I know you don’t typically want to talk about m2000 placements in the quarter, but can you give us some direction about…at least directionally about U.S. placements and timing on CT/GC, I thought we were hoping to maybe see a filing by calendar year-end ‘07?Well, as Abbott said in their earnings call earlier this week, the m2000 is now currently registered in approximately 50 countries around the world and they’ve achieved greater than 400 placements now. The placement rate that we are seeing continues to be strong in Europe and the uptake is developing in the United States. There was a nice number of placements there this quarter as well.Okay and what do you think about or I guess your thoughts currently on timing for chlamydia/gonorrhea filing?The last information that we provided on that was that we were targeting to go through the 510(k) clearance process and have a product on the market by approximately the end of our fiscal year. And we’re not changing that schedule at this point in time.Okay. So, no suspicion is to be drawn from the fact that we are now in ‘08 and that timing slipped a little bit?510(k) process, as you know, is or can be less than 90 days. These are 510(k) assays and so we’re just holding with the last projection. One point I should make and I believe there was a press release about this from Abbott, they achieved CE clearance on a new version of the chlamydia test that detects a new mutant strain. So they’re continuing to make progress on the STD front.Okay. And then if I could on CF. I guess the press release suggests that it’s still a little weak, I think it was weak last quarter. Is that type of erosion or weakness likely to persist for the remainder of the year? And can you remind us again the timing on the second-generation test?What we said last quarter is continuing to be observed in terms of our CF business. We have seen a large customer appears to have reduced inventory and appears to be potentially running the reaction with a different volume of constituents that has reduced the volume of product that they are purchasing from us, and so we are continuing to see that. In terms of a next-generation product, it’s too early for us to predict when that would be available. I would like to turn this over to Joel, who’s going to update or correct, I believe, some information he provided earlier.Yes. On a previous comment about equalization, I had made a reference to the prior-year second quarter, that comparison to the prior-year quarter should have been 3.5 million, not 2.7 million. So the equalization number this quarter, 4.8 million is correct and that compares against 3.5 million in the previous year’s second quarter.Okay, can I get in one more question, Kathy?You sure can.On KIF6 just so I’m clear on this. It sounds as though sort of a parallel track you guys will be unveiling the test with BHL and the same time going through a filing process with FDA, is that…that’s the right way to think about that?Yes. We currently are planning to develop an IVD product in the Group under the direction of Mike Zoccoli. That process takes longer and we would expect to take that product into a formal clinical trial and submit it for FDA review. In the meantime, our folks at Berkeley HeartLab have developed and are in the process of validating a laboratory-developed test and they would expect to offer that in the coming months.So, it sounds like that might actually be available at BHL by the end of the fiscal year?We expect it would be available before the end of the fiscal year.Is that part of your…I know it’s probably small, but is it part of your thinking on guidance, or would that be potential upside?We have included a very insignificant amount of revenue in our guidance relative to the KIF6 test.Okay. Thanks a lot.And our next question comes from the line of Charles Duncan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.Hi, good morning, folks, and congratulations on a good quarter of progress. Kathy, most of my questions have to do with the disease management service business that you restructured or set up. With regard to kind of the BHL test build that you mentioned 1.8 million in the year, what are some of the kind of primary drivers and can you give us some sense as to the number of test build with regard to growth in that aspect of the business versus a 16% revenue increase?Well, the primary driver of testing at Berkeley HeartLab has been based on their segmented, gradient gel electrophoresis technology, but they offer a whole panel of tests that can be ordered individually or as a group. And I’ll ask Chris Hall, whose Vice President of Clinical Operations for Berkeley HeartLab to comment further.Yes, we’ve sold a set of tests that allow a physician to personalize and monitor heart disease, and what’s driven it has been the proprietary tests that we offer that subfractionate the LDL and the HDL particles. We’ve surrounded that with tests that give somebody a…give a physician a complete snapshot of LDL and HDL and inflammation, and we also integrate a genetic marker to give some insight into…in both the risk of disease and treatment. And what’s been fueling the market has been the demand for that integrated approach that’s able to characterize the disease and then the ability to monitor it.Maybe I need to clarify my question. What I’m really wondering is, is it clinical data or let’s say detailing or say focus on third-party payers or maybe new tests, which is really driving the very positive growth trends in that business.Charles, I think it’s a combination of, first of all, accessing new physicians and new customers with existing physicians and expanding the test menu. It is a combination of those things.So, you would anticipate KIF6 to be a significant increase in that or a new initiative, would you plan to announce the availability of the service test?We haven’t decided exactly how we will commercialize the KIF6 test, how that will be announced, but it will be known when it happens. And we do expect KIF6 to be an important addition to the Berkeley HeartLab portfolio and also we think it will be an important product for us in our IVD business.And last question is, as you envision the IVDMIA version of that test. Are you currently envisioning a 510(k) type process or more of a PMA type process? What kind of…if you will, medical utility or label are you going to see covered [inaudible] on that test?We’re not exactly sure what registration activities will be required for our KIF6 product. We have had a couple of meetings with FDA around our cardiovascular genetic findings, and now that these papers have been published, we intend to meet with them soon and walk through a specific strategy for registration of KIF6.Excellent. Thanks for the added color. Congrats on a good quarter.Thank you.And our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.Kathy, how much did Berkeley contribute to revenues in the quarter?Peter, it’s Joel. We…the combination of Atria and Berkeley HeartLab is in the comparables that we listed this morning. We are not going to break out those revenues separately at this point in time.Okay, and then, the geographical distribution of Berkeley sales force, what is that and what markets have they targeted?Berkeley’s sales force addresses much of the United States, but it’s heavily concentrated in the Southeast and over to Texas, following what my boss likes to call, the “gravy belt” or the “barbecue belt” or wherever there’s a substantial amount of cardiovascular disease. And we are now increasing the number of sales reps and clinical educators, and expanding more both in the Northeast and in the West and in the Midwest.Okay, thanks, Kathy. And then on the milestones, is there anything in the guidance for any milestones for 2008, anything from Merck?In terms of the drug work, the small molecule work?Yeah.No, we do not forecast those milestones, because we have virtually no control over whether they get achieved or not.And I probably missed this. Can you give any color on uptake of m2000 in this quarter versus last quarter, any significant change geographically?I did mention earlier that Abbott said earlier in their conference call this week that there were greater than 400 placements now and they continue to see nice progress in Europe and some progress here in the United States as well.Okay. And then just finally, I don’t know if you can disclose this Dennis, but will both parts of the business, the molecular and Berkeley be profitable by the end the year or is one carrying the other?We have not disclosed that. Obviously, Berkeley can’t disclose.Okay, thank you so much.And our next question comes from the line Derik De Bruin with UBS. Please proceed.Hi, good morning.Good morning Derik.So, I guess on the first one now that you’re starting to really show profitability, could you just give us some idea on how to look at the tax rate?The tax rate isn’t going to change for a while. I’m not sure what the question–.That is a great problem to have.Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So, I mean basically the levels we had, the percentage we’ve had in this quarter has pretty much gone [inaudible] run rate?Yes. Essentially, yes.Okay. That’s all I was asking for. So, looking at the papers that you’ve published on the KIF6, I mean certainly some of the response from the scientific community was mixed, is a concern I think and some of the KIF6 wasn’t picked up in some of the home genome studies that have been done, for example. Given that uptake of any test that you want is going to require a lot of physician education, it’s going to require that. I mean what can you do to try to alleviate some of the criticisms that have been raised?Well, Derik I have Tom talk about the publications and some of the technical comments that have been made and then I’ll address the issue of how we plan to enter the market.But, I’ll just…I mean this was…this goes right to the rational for the Berkley Heart acquisition, which is the best, the very best that we can do is just to prove to people through getting direct access to physicians and a patient or a disease management environment that these things make sense and get the talking heads kind of set aside for a while. Tom, sorry.So, I think regarding the question of how well replicated this marker is, three papers that came out this week described results on 30,000 patients. But some of the commentators on the release had not actually seemed to be aware of the two other previous studies on an additional 20,000 patients. So, there’s almost 50,000 people these markers have been confirmed, and so far, it’s the, or one of the two most widely replicated cardiovascular markers period that’s ever been discovered. Secondly, on the whole-genome scans, a comment was made was that it had not been seen in one or more of those. But it’s not actually clear that this marker was tested in two of those studies. They only reported on a marker that had shown up as positive, but they didn’t report on the other markers that were positive in that study…those two studies. And therefore, it’s not clear whether it was positive or not because it’s not available from the data. We have other additional unpublished data as well that show that the market will hold up, and we’re very confident that it will in future studies.And what we would expect to do, Derik, is the tried and true method from the past. There will be additional studies, some supported by Celera, others by other investigators who are interested in this marker. And, as part of our clinical trial process, we will again have to validate the performance of the marker for both risk and statin benefit and these things take time. But we think these findings are so exciting, and with a very strong Berkeley HeartLab commercial organization behind it, we think the prospects for KIF6 are very good.Great, thank you, that makes a lot of sense. I guess; could you just educate me a little bit on what the biological mechanism of action is, or why you think that KIF6 [inaudible] actually benefit from the statin therapy. Give me a little bit of biology on it.Well, like other whole genome studies that have discovered novel markers, we are discovering genes that seem to be strongly associated with diseases that were not previously known from the biology that’s come. That’s the advantage of doing a whole-genome study, is to discover new markers that one could then study the mechanism of. That being said, it is clear that this particular gene is highly expressed in the vasculature of people with coronary artery disease, despite what some commentators have said. But actually probably more important is that this marker is not only a marker for risk, it clearly predicts those patients who will have a greater than average benefit from statin response, from statin treatment, regardless of whether or not the statin affects their cholesterol level. And in the [inaudible] study, their high dose Lipitor showed an effect on survival within three days. It is very likely that that is due to a non-cholesterol effect of Lipitor on something like plaque vulnerability. So, we believe that that is an area of mechanistic possibility for KIF6 that deserves active study. And they actually predict those people who are at risk of a ruptured plaque, whether or not they have a reduction in their cholesterol level or not.Great, thank you very much.[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of Amrit Nagpal with Weintraub, please proceed.Hi guys, can you hear me?Yes, we can.I had a question about BHL from an operational perspective. Can you give us your thoughts on whether you feel like there are opportunities to enhance the current operations of BHL separate from the KIF6 launch? And then secondarily, can you review the IP around KIF6? And the last question on the KIF6 commercialization plan, with the Berkeley HeartLab’s developed test, will the Berkeley HeartLab’s reps be able to promote the product actively or is that restricted because there won’t be FDA license?So, let me start with the first part of your question. In terms of the enhancement of BHL’s operations, two…that we are taking there. First of all, is the expansion of the commercial operation. The increase in the number of both sales reps and clinical educators, which basically expands our reach across the country, and that will enhance operations. And then secondly and to a much smaller degree, as we are integrating Berkeley HeartLab into Celera, we are consolidating certain functions like human resources, etcetera, and that should enhance both sides of the groups at Celera. In terms of the patent for KIF6, when this discovery was first made several years ago, we filed on it in the United States and major countries and…but expect to prevail in terms of those patent filings because as it has been pointed out, no one else seems to have seen this finding and we believe, therefore, that we are first and will secure a patent on KIF6 findings.So, those are pending but not issued?Pardon me?Those patents are pending, but not yet issued?Correct.And if I could just add to that, other SNPs in the KIF6 gene and surrounding the KIF6 gene have also been extensively studied and this SNP is the most informative SNP with regards to disease prediction and statin response.Yes.They were filed on as well.Yes. Typically we file on the whole circle of findings, and then as we narrow it down we drop those early patent filings and then the third issue, in terms of commercialization, Berkeley HeartLab will take its typical process for commercializing a new test in terms of how it promotes and details the product to physicians, and Chris would you like to comment on that?Yes, we’ve launched four, five products now in the marketplace successfully and we’ve built a pretty structured process and the sales reps can all be educated about on how the physician gives KIF6 to the market and the clinical educators will be educated about how to talk to physicians and patients and we plan to launch it in a pretty structured way.So, I guess what I’m trying to understand though is given that…there’s been a lot of focus on the regulatory status of diagnostic test. Would you be able to actively promote or would you just sort of be able to show the ACC publication and have physicians come to the conclusion on their own that this is a valuable test. I’m just trying to understand what level of how aggressive your sales force can be or how direct they can be?I think you are getting a little bit ahead of us. We’re just finalizing plans for launch of the service test and at any rate, as I pointed out before, we do intend to register the product with FDA that would define very specific claims that we would be making about the product.All right. Thank you very much.And we have a follow-up from the line of Charles Duncan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.Hi guys, thanks for taking my follow-up. One clarification on the IP with regard to KIF6, did you file just on diagnostics use, or did you also include therapeutics use?All of our patent claims include both diagnostics and therapeutics.Have you guys been talking with Cytokinetics about their IP around that gene?We are aware of other people, including Cytokinetics operating in the KIF6 area.Okay, and then regard to regulatory timelines on an IVDMIA version of the product. Can you give us any additional color on those timelines when we could see increased visibility of that program?Charles, this is an IVD product, not IVDMIA, just a minor correction there.Excuse me.No, that’s okay. Just in terms of the timeline, we really have to…now that we have the publications in hand, meet with the FDA and find out the answer to all the typical questions about whether it would be…whether we could do…use prospectively collected, retrospectively analyzed samples, whether we could incorporate into the clinical trial process work that’s already been conducted and is part of the extensive publications and those types of questions. So I would rather not comment on how long that would take until after we’ve met probably a couple of more times with the FDA.That makes sense. But do you kind of expect those meetings to occur in the next six months, three to six months?We’re planning to get in there as soon as they are ready to see us and we can get on their time schedule.Okay, good thanks.Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A session. I’d like to turn it back to Mr. Dworkin for closing remarks.Thank you. Thanks to all for participating in this call today. A reminder that management’s remarks will be posted within the hour on our websites and the audio replay will be available later today using the phone numbers listed in today’s press releases. Thanks.Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation, you may now disconnect, thank you very much.\",\n",

       "  '2007-10-26 06:01:13'): 'Good morning, my name is Candice and I’ll be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Applera Corporation, first quarter fiscal 2008 earnings conference call. At this time all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. During the speaker’s presentation there will be multiple question-and-answer session. [Operator’s instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Peter Dworkin, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Applera Corporation. Please proceed sir.Thank you operator, good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Applera management to discuss the first quarter fiscal 2008 financial results that we issued earlier this morning for Applera Corporation and its Applied Biosystems Group and Celera Group. As in previous earnings calls, this morning we will discuss both of our businesses separately starting with Applied Biosystems and then moving on to Celera. The Celera portion of the call will begin at 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time. If the Applied Biosystems portion of the call should run beyond 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time, the Celera portion will follow immediately thereafter. Present today are Tony White, Chief Executive Officer of Applera; Dennis Winger, Chief Financial Officer of Applera; and executives from the Applera operating businesses. A reminder that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements about Applera’s businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure that are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in Applera’s filings with the SEC. We also will be discussing historical and forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures for Applied Biosystems. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today’s press release and on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of the Applied Biosystems website. The website is www.appliedbiosystems.com. Please note that after this call, the text of these prepared remarks will be posted on the IR section of the Applera web site and on the separate Investor Relations site of the Applied Biosystems and Celera web sites. Now, Tony White and Applied Biosystems Executive Vice President, Mark Stevenson will comment on the performance of Applied Biosystems during the quarter. And also on the call today is Bill Craumer who recently joined as IR Director for Applied Biosystems. Tony?Thank David, good morning everyone. First quarter fiscal 2008 revenue growth of 5% was generally in line with the expectations we called out in July when we gave our fiscal 2008 outlook. Given the unusual strength, 15% growth in the prior year quarter. And we continue to expect, as Dennis Winger will discuss later in the call, mid to high single digit revenue growth for the full fiscal year, with improving margins. We are tracking well with two important goals for Applied Biosystems for fiscal 2008. The continued strength of our consumables product lines, which is up 12% during the quarter, led by a robust new product offering, and further expansion in the gross margins and the operating margins of the company. We have made good progress on two important business initiatives that were announced in the first quarter. We have paid Morgan Stanley $600 million under an accelerated share repurchase program, and they have delivered to the Corporation 16 million shares of Applied Biosystems stock, which is approximately 8.7% of the shares’ outstanding. And depending on the levels at which ABI shares trade over approximately the next six months, we may receive additional shares at the conclusion of that transaction. Also in August, we announced sort of the Applera Board of Directors had retained Morgan Stanley to explore possible alternatives to the Company’s current tracking stock structure. Excuse me. While a final decision has not been made related to this complex analysis, efforts to date indicate a preference towards dissolving the current structure and creating separate publicly traded companies for Applied Biosystems and Celera. We intend to update shareholders as the analysis is completed and this decision is finalized. The analysis is complex because Morgan Stanley is analyzing and reporting to the Board on all structural alternatives, together with the anticipated consequences of each. The Board will process that analysis into a final decision based on the best interests of all shareholders. The process for unwinding a tracking stock into two separate stocks typically takes something on the order of a year or more, but our goal is to finalize and execute any decision about by our fiscal year-end, which is June 30, 2008. No assurances can be given that the Board will ultimately authorize such a transaction or that, if authorized; such a transaction will be consummated. And now I’ll ask Mark Stevenson to report in more detail on market.Thanks, Tony. As Tony mentioned, a 5% growth this quarter was generally in line with our expectations given the unusual strength in the prior year quarter. It was a challenging quarter for instruments, down 4% versus the prior year quarter, as 15% instrument growth in the prior year period took a toll on the comparison. On the positive side, our continued strategic focus on consumables and application-specific products led to a 12% increase in consumables, and the \"Other Sources of Revenue” category increased 10%. “Other Sources of Revenue” consist primarily of our services business and license and royalty income. License income included a real-time PCR instrument license granted last month, further strengthening our licensed IP portfolio in this technology category. The 2% year-on-year decline in the DNA Sequencing product category reflected a decline in instruments and increases in DNA sequencing consumables. We attribute much of the weakness in the instruments category to the tight academic grant funding environment and the interest in next-generation sequencing technology. Also, as expected, fewer sequencers were shipped into forensic labs during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 following large shipments in the prior year quarter, although we are seeing the pull through of forensic kits which we book in the Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics product category. We anticipate the same factors may cause results in the DNA Sequencing product category in the second fiscal quarter being similar to those in the first fiscal quarter. Despite this, we continue to anticipate modest growth in DNA Sequencing for the fiscal year, as we work through a transition in our sequencing business to include SOLiD as well as the continued use of capillary electrophoresis, CE technology for research and commercial applications. We are excited to be formally launching the SOLiD platform today at ASHG in San Diego. The current release is capable of delivering up to 4 billion bases of sequence data per run. It’s approximately four times the throughput of the early access systems and the highest throughput offered by any commercial next-generation system. Scalability has doubled every quarter during the last 15 months and we see potential for 6 to 10 giga basis per run. Read lengths have increased to 35 base pairs. Data accuracy is another important performance metric, and we believe SOLiD’s two interrogations of each base at two-base encoding and mate pair analysis ensure the highest level of accuracy amongst next-generation’s systems. Several customers from the U.S., Europe, Japan and Australia are presenting data to their SOLiD, on SOLiD at ASHG showing its capabilities for a range of applications, including digital gene expression, whole genome re-sequencing, and targeted re-sequencing. Finally, it is worth noting that a number of customers have confirmed in public meetings that they are in the early stages of adopting next-generation systems and are having some significant issues with up time and stability on competitive systems. Feedback from customers and our experience in the sequencing market validate the belief we have shared with the financial community for months that throughput, data accuracy, robustness, low project costs, and service and support will be the most important factors for success in this marketplace, and these are the parameters where we believe we have advantages. We are pleased with the early order rates and diversity of more sophisticated sequencing customers; including genome centers, core academic labs, and commercial service labs from various parts of the world, that are placing orders for SOLiD. Customary with our corporate policy, it is not our plan to give shipment numbers each quarter. We believe our success in next-generation sequencing will be gained over time, as we continue to make improvements to the system and make our customers successful with their applications. As we announced earlier this month, researchers published from the sequencing of the first human diploid genome, all the DNA from both sets of chromosomes. This landmark sequencing study has shed light on how we believe scientists will carry out future analyses of human genomes. The study revealed that there is as much as 5-times more genetic variation between two individuals than was previously estimated. To understand how that variation contributes to disease or individual response to treatment for disease, researchers will need to identify the amount, kind and specific location of variations within the genome and this will be one of the drivers of the market for next generation sequencing. I’ve spent a fair amount of time discussing sequencing because of its obvious timeliness and the interest in the market. Now let me move on to non-sequencing businesses. The Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics category, our largest at 36% of our revenue, remained a standout in the first quarter, with a 15% growth over the prior-year quarter. This category is increasingly driven by application-specific reagent products. Among the strong contributors to growth were Ambion consumables, real-time PCR master mixes for gene expression and genotyping applications, TaqMan gene expression assays, and TaqMan microRNA assays. We are particularly pleased by the adoption of our unique TaqMan array product line, our 384 well micro fluidic card, which is enabling new applications such as microRNA profiling across academic and pharmaceutical segments. We believe new consumable products will continue to drive growth in the real-time PCR category, with a number of launches scheduled for this quarter. We are also utilizing our know-how to offer more service-based products that help customers become productive more quickly and stimulate AB product sales. For instance, our new forensic validation support and training programs launched in the first quarter should help drive forensic kit sales in this category. The Mass Spectrometry product revenue category increased 4% as compared to the prior year quarter, when revenues rose 19%, setting up a particularly difficult comparison for this quarter. We continue to see strong acceptance of the QTrap product line across our core Pharma, biotech and CRO customers for small molecule applications, in protein biomarker applications, and in the applied markets. QTrap sales were the biggest driver of growth in mass spec systems during the quarter. Moderators to growth in the mass spec category were funding delays in Europe and business challenges in Japan. In the Applied Markets, we continue our focus on developing targeted applications, workflows and complete systems for food, environmental and forensic toxicology applications. As part of this strategy, we introduced the Cliquid™ Drug Screen and Quant Software for a Routine Forensic Toxicology, a new, mass-spec-based automated toxicology testing application designed to better identify drugs of abuse for forensic investigations. The software can deliver faster results, more thorough screening and, ultimately, more accurate analysis to be used as evidence in criminal court cases. AB’s success in driving growth stems from a relentless focus on markets and technology segments where AB can win and fully support our customers. Our focus this year is on SOLiD, consumables for the research and applied markets, and continuing to introduce innovative mass spectrometry solutions. We have also continued to increase our support for growth opportunities at the regional level, especially in emerging markets such as China. We believe the understanding we have of customer needs, relevant applications, and the innovative solutions we can deliver, position AB well for the future. Now Dennis Winger will comment on Applied Biosystems’ financial results for the quarter.Thank you, Mark. As outlined in today’s press release, during the first quarter of both fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Group recorded items that affected the comparability of results. For the first quarter of 2008, the Group recorded pre-tax items that increased income before taxes by approximately $5 million. These items included a gain of approximately $7.6 million primarily due to a settlement and licensing agreement and $2.6 million of amortization expenses related to acquired intangibles. Also recorded during the quarter were tax charges of $1.8 million. Gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was 55.8 % compared to 53.7% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margin continues a multi-year trend. As in previous quarters, gross margins in the first quarter continued to benefit from lower costs enzymes. Other factors positive to gross margin included the favorable impact of foreign currency and increased royalty and license revenue. These benefits were partially offset by inventory-related costs for the 1700 reader for our Gene Expression Arrays, a product line we are discontinuing, and the inclusion of the United States Air Force contract revenue in the prior year. During the first quarter, selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% from the prior year level due to a number of factors including increased employee-related costs, particularly in sales and marketing. Reversal in the prior year quarter of a $5 million litigation-related accrual, which created a lower level of legal expenses in the prior-year quarter; and the unfavorable impact of the currency. As expected, R&D expenditures increased 12% in the first quarter over the prior year primarily due to further development of the SOLiD next-generation sequencing system. We expect SOLiD R&D expenses to moderate starting in the second fiscal quarter now that the system is in full commercial release. First quarter fiscal 2008 earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.32, an increase of approximately 10% compared to $0.29 in the prior year. The net effect of foreign currency on fiscal 2008 first quarter EPS was a benefit of approximately $0.03 compared to the prior year period. The Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction that the Group executed late in the quarter reduced earnings per share in the first quarter by $0.01 per share, due to the mechanics and the timing of the program. For the full fiscal year, we anticipate that this transaction will be accretive by $0.01 per share. This is our current estimate. The level of accretion is influenced by several factors, among them the price of the shares repurchased as well as the level of interest rates. The reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financials can be found in today’s press release as well as on the Financial Reports page of the Investor Relations section of our website, www.appliedbiosystems.com. Cash flow from continuing operations was $97.1 million and capital expenditures were $9.5 million for the quarter. At the end of the first quarter accounts [inaudible] $414.1 million, representing 64 days sales outstanding, and inventory was a $148.8 million, representing 3.6 months of inventory on hand. At of the end of the quarter, cash and short term investments were $277.2 million, down from $494.5 million as of June 30, 2007. This decrease was largely the result of a $600 million payment to Morgan Stanley for the Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction, a portion of which was funded with cash with the balance coming from $275 million in short-term borrowings. Applied Biosystems has the following expectations regarding its financial performance for fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Revenue Growth Rate: The Group expects mid to high single digit growth assuming current exchange rates. Revenues are expected to increase for both instruments and consumables. The Group anticipates revenue growth in the DNA Sequencing, Real-Time PCR/Applied Genomics, and Mass Spectrometry categories and revenue declines in the Core PCR and DNA Synthesis category and in the Other Product Lines category. Quarterly year-over-year revenue changes may be different from our annual expectations due to a variety of factors, including the timing of customer orders and disbursements of government’s funding. The Group expects continued gross margin expansion on the fiscal 2007 gross margin of 55.3%. SG&A as a percent of total revenues is expected to be slightly higher than prior year level of 28.3%. R&D as a percentage of total revenues is expected to be approximately equal to or slightly below the prior year level of 9.7%. The Group expects an increase in operating margin in fiscal 2008 compared to the operating margin of 17.2% in the prior year, excluding special items in both fiscal years as described in the use of Non-GAAP Financial section in the press release. The Group expects the effective annual tax rate used to calculate non-GAAP financial measures to be approximately 31%, compared to approximately 30% in fiscal 2007. The Group expects non-GAAP EPS to increase faster than the annual growth rate of revenue. This includes the incremental impact of stock based compensation and the new effective tax rate. The total impact of these items on fiscal 2008 Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.05 a share. The total pre-tax impact of FAS 123R, accounting for stock based compensation in Fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately $22.0 million, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.08.  The Group expects capital spending to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million. The Group believes this outlook and its fiscal year 2008 financial performance could be affected by a number of factors and other risks and uncertainties outlined in today’s press release and in our SEC filings with the SEC. These comments reflects management’s current outlook. Applera does not have any current intention to update this outlook and plans to revisit the outlook for its businesses this quarter when financial results are announced. Thank you and we’ll now take your questions about Applied Biosystems. Question and AnswerThank you sir. [Operator’s instructions.] One moment while we compile a list of questions. Our first question will come from the line of Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank, please proceed.Good morning everyone.Hey Ross.So Mark I am trying to understand the sequencing business. You made two comments relative to the performance and I was just trying to clarify versus other things you have said. So you mentioned that the funding environment was relatively weak or slightly weaker than expected. I think that was sort of the gist of it and that the results showed some weakness there because of the impending launch of SOLiD. Can you sort of characterize what you think the total funding picture is right now, sort of the inclusive of next gen sequencing not just for the capillary market. And also talk to is that partially driven by Japan and what is really driving that weakness in Japan as you are the second player in two days to really discuss that as being a market, a bit of unexpected weakness?Okay Ross there is a lot in that question, so let me try and take some of. I mean the academic involvement that I told you relates a little bit to the tightness of NIH funding just a reality of who is getting gross funding. What we are seeing with next generation sequencing is actually stimulating tremendous amount of funds for sequencing but for new applications. For experiments that people couldn’t do before such as some of the digital gene expression looking at some of the analysis of transcripts that experiments just weren’t being done before. Some of the, going back and doing many genomes at a time. And so that’s where we are seeing the funding or is getting funded out of academic funding but also sort of donors to academic funding coming in and trying to get translational mix and funding. So that’s the environment that we are seeing. We further this transition going on because of these many moving factors between, what’s getting funded for CE and what’s getting funded for next generation sequencing. We continue to see the use of CE as you see by the growth in our DNA sequencing consumables. But people are setting up and funding new projects in the academic funding. With regard to Japan, the overall market in Japan continues. As you know Ross, two years there, there’s not a lot of visibility in Japan sometimes to what really goes on. It’s a pretty opaque market. So it’s hard sometimes to exactly co-relate between what the Japanese Government maybe saying is happening in academic funding, what actually flows. So that was my general comment on Japan. I will let Laura maybe comment specifically because my comment on Japan was not my spectrometry, so she can make a couple of comments on that.Thanks Mark. Yes I do believe in Japan across several markets, particularly in NASDAQ but it’s primarily in the industrial area market there is we are seeing some weakness. So I think that’s what Mark’s comment was relating to particularly in Pharma, Cardio mix. It’s truly across the board in multiple areas there. There continues to be some weakness in Japan.I just wanted to make sure that there was no change in the stand specially, on the academic side to any potential weak CE driven by the success of your next gen product. I think I understand that correct that’s not what you were trying to express.No that wasn’t. You are correct Ross.Okay and just one quick other house keeping item for Dennis. Could you just walk through the actual step by step impact of the ASR on your share count we should think about modeling that? Because I just want to make sure that I am thinking about the impact correct on a sort of quarter by quarter basis. I understand how it works this quarter given the benefit. Are we going to start to see the benefit next quarter on the average diluted share count in the EPS calculation is that right?Yes you will see more of the benefit in the later quarters. There are two impacts, obviously there is a reduction on interest income because the cash balances are lower results in an increase in interest expenses we borrowed money to buy these shares. So that’s a negative impact on the P&L. Positive impact obviously is a reduced number of shares and you have to weight those shares over the course of the year, the impact will be greater in Q3 and 4 than it is in Q2.Okay so the actual, so you don’t get to see the immediate impact of the ASR in Q2 is the question, right that’s correct?No that’s not what I said, what I said is the impact will be greater in Q3 and Q4.Yes that’s okay I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Alright, perfect.Make sure I understand it; the average share count in Q2 will reflect the fact that we got the shares…It will but we won’t have the shares till the fourth quarter.Fourth quarter right. So that’s right Ross it’s a question of average share count for the quarter and as we are getting them in, I think that’s where the balance it gets a little stronger in the quarter we have got a whole quarter of it.Okay I really appreciate that clarification.And as I understand it once Morgan Stanley completes covering because they borrowed the shares that they have to go and get those. Once they complete those then we can initiate the balance is that right?Yes it will be several months before …Right so we can’t go back into market till they are done.Okay perfect thank you.[Operator’s instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Quintin Lai of Robert W Baird.Hi good morning. In your press release you put out a comment that said you estimate the next gen sequencing could be $450 million annually by 2011. As you were building--Hello?I don’t know what that’s all about, keep going.Okay. So do you still believe that $450 million is added to CE or how do you see that growing in relation to the general CE business?Yes Quintin this is Mark here. It is a complicated scenario to model out this transition. So we have been trying to give as much guidance as we can and quite frankly as I am sure you are seeing as well in the market it’s a very dynamic situation going on. So we are giving the best guidance we can to model this out. We do impact; expect some cannibilsation of the CE business. So we have projected that. The research segment will continue to show some declines. We think there will be some growth continuing in the commercial segments and we include in that the forensic segment where we show the kit sales in the real time and applied genomics category. When we had a sort of look out and we net it in that 2011 picture we failed the net opportunity at the moment is about a $160 million so netting those two out.Okay super, thank you very much. And then Dennis with respect to the gross margin expectation for the full year you put out 55.8% here in Q1, you have got 55.3% for the full year. Is that just accommodating for the launch of SOLiD lower gross margins for an early stage launch?SOLiD is certainly part of that, not really no. There is not lower gross margins because of the launch its SOLiD. The gross margin rates are effective a lot of sectors, royalty being one of them is    royalties being one of them as you noted we did have some good royalty payments this quarter you don’t always get those quarter after quarter. That’s probably the largest factor.So do you anticipate the SOLiD machines then I guess will be immediately profitable as you launch in the second half of fiscal 08?With all of our spends are all these profitable as a gross, perhaps the margins a little. Ones that are never make it to market so it’s kind of down.Yes we are trying to make money on SOLiD.All right thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of Tom Weisel partners. Please proceed.Hi Tony, could you talk about real time PCR and compare that the over all segment growth there but how did real time PCR versus how did Ambion do or Mark?Yes Paul I can give you little more color on what’s going on so, in that real time PCR and flags market category we have got  a lot of different product line designed to my comments. We have been focused on applications specific product lines. So for example my interest is in micro RNAs and then that pulls together Ambion’s sample prep kit, it pulls together 384 micro fluidic card. It pulls together our 7900 instruments and the analyst system supports that we offer from our flag by systems. Kind of trying to think about it as a complete system. These are very dynamic and competitive marketing real time PCR instrumentation as I have referred to before. We have addressed that by introducing 2 new products step 1 and step 1 plus that give us lower price points into the market place and so those compete very well. We also continue to integrate Ambion work flows into other sample and prep analysis product lines that come out both in out forensic kits which you will see in some of the other applied market categories that are in that segment. So there is s range of things going on that contribute to the very healthy growth in that segment.How many probes are on the website now for RTPCR?Oh that’s the question I am not sure I am prepared. I think there are what, 2 million plus mix [inaudible] gene on snip outs and then on gene expression or at least the whole gene or at least the 30000 and there is all the micro RNA. So we stopped counting to be honest, we used to issue them and count them, we have been more focused on making sure the turn around for our customers are quick because there is more and more discoveries the role of non coding RNAs, be it micro RNA, with using Ambion RNA they knock down making assays for all of those. Exxon’s that are involved in people to discover a new area. So we have kind of stopped counting the number of assays and focused on sort of customer service in turn around times to support our business growth.Okay thank you.Our next question will come from a line of John Groberg of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a good quarter. My first question is for Mark. Mark as you look out on the real time PCR as a which is, I think the strongest quarter been strong and as you look out 2010 beyond how do you manage for that? What are your plans given the pending patent expirations that are coming down the pipe [inaudible] the royalties that?Well firstly we got to take into account what we have built here when we talk about the enzyme capability, when we talk about Ambion is a capability in ABI that we are leveraging into many new products, introductions and launches. So lot of the growth that you are seeing and when we look out, we feel good about the growth that we have coming in that category and we leveraging that capability you see into different application be it in a research market place, be it in applied markets and that’s where we look out in the next couple of years. Clearly we look at the IP portfolio and that’s out there and we have it on our minds but that’s in the market place we have licensed now the majority of the company supplying systems into the market place, so we don’t expect to change in the competitive position but we obviously look out and take that into consideration our longer three five year planning horizon.Can I just add to that, we have got this question lot when the basic PCR patterns were expiring and around of this you have always got life cycles for all your technologies and the trick is to replace those things when they run a course to, you know we invest in R&D and they invest in our new technologies and that will be part of the normal life cycle, mange the process that we go through all the time. The real time PCR’s can around for a long time but it will change. Hopefully different characteristics won’t follow.Okay thanks and then on the, maybe working up on that. On the NASDAQ, is there any sense at all about market share shifts and I am just wondering in general you have been very strong obviously in small molecule, seems to be a big movement towards cardiomics[ph] how do you feel you are competing in the cardiomics[ph] space?Yes, I think, I mean overall the fundamentals of this business is very solid. We have strong positions across multiple technologies, across multiple markets and part of our strategy is continuing to expand into new areas. Particularly, just introduced a new flash coin system utilized in the discovery area for really graphic screening, of potential new drug compounds. We worked very closely with the key Pharma leaders in the industry globally, to develop this product and it’s been very well received in the market. We have also just introduced a new system for forensic toxicology and that has gotten very strong response from our customer base, allows them to very rapidly analyze drugs of abuse, performance enhancing drugs in minutes versus the time it used to take before. So overall again I think the fundamental for the business is strong, it’s strong across all market segments with our push into new application areas and also our continuing focus on innovation. So I feel very solid about the business.You don’t feel as I mean, maybe putting words into your mouth but I guess the question was around market share shifts. I know in any given quarter there can be movement but do you feel overall as though you are holding your own relative to what you are seeing in the market?Well I think, sorry to interrupt you, I think you have alluded to we have had extremely strong growth for a long period of time and I think our position in the market remains very solid.I think fiscal would show that we have actually worst cases hold share usually regain share and nothing has changed. So…And Tony the last question for you. Just from a strategic point of view you talked about the overall review that Morgan and Stanley is doing largely, if I may assume, from a financial, from a shareholder point of view. But if you just step back strategically and you look at your business, you see any benefits of the ABI, the instrument side and research side being a part of a larger company at this point? Do you think that would do anything? Again strategically speaking is that something that would add a new value to the portfolio product?I don’t guess I understand your question. ABI being a part of larger company or Caleb, I didn’t understand your question.I am just wondering you talked about, wanted it from a strategic perspective is there any? You talked about the rationale before having the ABI together was largely financial now. They’re turning cash full possible. I am just wondering if you look at it strategically do you think that ABI would benefit from being a part of a larger company and large organization or do you think its better and its kind of at the right side that it is or growing in new markets?Well I mean that’s a pretty hypothetical question and I am not going to put the company up for sale here this morning so. That’s such a big question, part of a bigger one. I’m being, I am sure there are always benefits in a variety of different business combinations that might be out there. There are also probably offsetting things. I can tell you there is, I don’t have any burning agenda here that says that makes any sense to us but I really don’t. Your question is so hypothetical I really don’t know how to comment on it.Strategically if people talk about changes in markets and dynamics and some might even thing we need to scale or--Scale what? We are pretty much the biggest company in the field right here. In terms of being relatively peer play in life sciences and tools so being part of a bigger one I don’t…[Inaudible] market shift and what’s going on? I think you kind of answered the question.Thank you. I tried to I just don’t think I have any examples in mind.Our next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company, please proceed.Hey good morning. You guys put out what I thought was actually a pretty good gross margin number and it definitely sounds as though the consumable mix was a bit higher than you expected. Is there any way for you to provide a little bit of detail on how much of the gross margin performance is attributable to, possibly weaker than expected instrument sales versus positive drivers, such as better end time costs maybe quicker than expected consumable flow through, especially in applied market consumables and if its more of a latter factor but towards the performance. Is it fair to assume that this is going to continue quarterly throughout the year?I think our gross margin expansion is not a function of the mix between instruments and consumables so that’s a popular notion that I think is carried over from the diagnostics world. We are from a sort of typically give it away or placed. Usually we have pretty good gross margins across the field. The only time mix really affects us, is when we have a strong mass spec quarter, because we had a joint venture with somebody and that actually from a mix point of view hurts our overall gross margins, because we bring it through at a lower rate. Our gross margin expansion has been planned; we have been talking about this working on it for a long time. And we have got a number of elements in there on the cost side that have been contributing to it. We have also been strengthening our product positions across a variety of areas in the consumables area and that’s been good. So I think all those things that you mentioned are contributors but I don’t think it’s the specific difference between the mix between overall consumables and instruments and frankly consumables were stronger than we thought they were going to be this quarter. They were pretty much right in line with what we expected, what we planned for.Okay that’s helpful. Is it fair to assume that some of the higher growth areas of consumables, meaning like a supplied markets and ambience simply, are those a little bit higher margin than the corporate average?We don’t go into detail on the market.That’s a slippery slope.Okay understood. One question on the solid roll out. The checks I have done so far have suggested that in the early going you guys have done a really good job. The selling the utility of the instrument based on a few metrics including, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks throughput and the advantages of your Matepair [ph] library. One area where I’ve heard you guys maybe had a bit of a disadvantage related to your competition out of the box at least is just in the sample perhaps being relatively more cumbersome. So the extent you agree with that, are there steps that you think can be taken to simplify sample profits. And so is that something that can occur in a fairly short time frame?Yes I agree to both of your comments and your proposals. We think as we have said the key metrics of the throughput and data accuracy that were toughness, the project and services and support. And are pleased to hear that when we hear from our customers then that’s where we are winning in the market and the customers are stopping and thinking about what they are about to do next. With regard to the sample preparation, one of the things we have done is mapped out what we expect improvements to be over the next year or so. We have been sharing that with our customers. We see ways to simplify the sample prep to water made beds. We have done this in many technologies before. ABI has a lot of experience in doing this, and introducing the product and relentlessly improving it and going through. So we saw the technologies we go through the next couple of years, we are going to alternate some of those steps and eliminate some of those steps as we go forward here.In the mean time I did have a customer last week tell me that, didn’t mind spending a little more time on the front end if they got several times more data  on the back end from the same exercise. The efficiency still favors us in the total workflow, by a wide margin. So while Mark said we will make that, improvements to that. I think if you look at the overall work flow we still haven’t made it.Do you think the first section of that workflow; I guess advantage or just how to put the workflow as it’s looked at, it’s proceeded to be different between say a large, a large lab versus kind of a less traditional customer in the sequencing space?No I think in the end the customer’s, the small labs the reason they’re buying it is the reason is to be able to compete with the large genome centers and do experiments that they just couldn’t do before. So the throughput of that system and the cost for that project when they get up and gearing is going to be the driver. Also as you mentioned the Matepair [ph] Libraries a lot of these customers are running to take the Matepairs in long hours and particularly the distance between the Matepairs, which is a key advantage if you’re going to do some resequencing work. The customers actually have the systems now that we’re shipping in October saying to us, that’s a key advantage that is worth having whether its small or large customers. Remember its only today we’re introducing commercial systems. S o customers are yet to get experience fully of this throughput.Great thank you very much for taking my question.Our next question comes from the line of john Sullivan of Lorraine Swan, please proceed.Hey guys good morning. Couple of quick questions, a follow up to earlier questions in mass spectrometry first. Laura can you check briefly about the regulated mass specs setting and is there any change in the mass spec technology or tools that are, is there any change in preference by customers that are using mass spec to generate data for regular choice of missions?Not understanding your question, when you say the regulative, can you be more specific?Yes, just let us see clinical, clinical mass spec where data is being generated for submissions to the FTA, around new drug candidates.Okay like BMP case, clinical trials and--Yes.No there’s no change there. That’s still a very robust strong market and there’s a lot of activity in terms of the numbers samples needed and the throughput needed. But now that’s a very strong market overall and for us in particular.Okay thanks very much. And then a strategic question for Mark I suppose? Do you see tools and inconsumables for cellular analysis as an opportunity for AB? And if you do, how do you plan to participate to a greater extent?Yes we do see some opportunities there and we’ve just been working through the right way for us to develop and grow in to that market. I mean one of the areas we’ve been focused on and we started to see some announcements on us, is looking around the cellular analysis in stem cells and characterizing it at a molecular level using TaqMan chemistry, the bakers of the through potency of the stem cell.  And that’s one of the entry points we think AB can enter in to this market and then look at additional opportunities in characterizing stem cells, single cancer cells in that area. So that’s where AB is looking at and you’ve seen some announcements around stem cells to start with.Thanks very much.Our next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard of First Analysis, please proceed.A couple of book keeping questions for Dennis. Dennis on the accelerated share repurchase, at current stock prices it looks like you should be able to give us 17 million plus shares from your $600 million. Is that accurate or is there a bigger spread there that I’m appreciating?Well I don’t know. I don’t know how the stock price is going to be over the next 46 months so I don’t know how many shares we’re going to get in? I can get the stock price of today and calculate it for the nearest year, sure. But we’re not going to buy these shares all today. We’re going to buy them over the next 3, 4 months. Morgan Stanley is, and that will impact the number of shares we get.Okay at that timeframe is helpful. And then also, the $270 million plus in your balance sheet, does that represent the minimum cash balance, you’re comfortable with? Beyond that you’ll use debt? Is that the correct way to read?No, not necessarily. Some of that, more than 50% of that cash is actually off shore. Its there is could be used for off shore expansion or for off shore acquisitions. To bring it back to the U.S. would have tax consequences and it’s not our current plan to bring it back. The U.S. cash balances are slightly less than a $100 million, still like that much lower than that level.Okay thank you.You’re welcome.Our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin with UBS, please proceed.I thought you had forgotten me there for a minute.How do we forget you?Yes I know. It’s been 7 years how can you forgive me?It isn’t Derek that we don’t try.So over the last, looking historically so over the last 7 years, you guys have done a good job of lowering your R&D as a percentage of sales. You basically now are improving gross margin. What is there in terms of SG&A leverage?That’s a great question I hate to admit it since it came from you but and it’s one way struggle with and it’s running. If you ever take a few basis points around 28% of sales rate that it suitably I think it would be better. But I am going on 12 years now where I haven’t been able to make through that in a meaningful way and still fund the opportunities that we think we have to fund for growth out in front of the business. For example, we think there are growth opportunities in Asia Pacific area and may be now even developing in Latin America that. So frankly you have to, if you follow our philosophy you have to lay the track first. You have to get the infrastructure place, you have to get competent people on the ground, you have to, before you start selling platform systems you have to get your body to provide service to the customer, application support to the customer. We can’t just add mail this stuff around the world. And so there’s always demand on our core expenses to reduce them to pay for these non-initiatives and keep it line with revenue growth. We have had a major project underway here inside the division now for sometime, looking at infrastructure cost and at least we can further reduce those. But mainly to opt and we are having some successful with that, some considerable success but it’s to make sure that these new investment opportunities are all incremental to the overall expense line and to keep things flat. So to my disappointment and I guess to some point I don’t think I have experienced any great opportunities for big leverage there. As long, as long as we see these new opportunities develop that require fund investment, kind of wish it was different and there might be chances to get more leverage in the future but right now that seems to been the case.Okay, that’s the great answer, thanks. Dennis could you just give us a little bit more in terms of the expectations I guess for the net-interest expense or interest income? What are you paying on your debt and just give us some general guidance on that?Yes I can show it to you. The current rate on the debt, which it’s a flowing rate, but it’s currently about 5.8%-5.9% and its $275 of our million outstanding so that’s what it is. Current earnings on our cash is around 5%.And you mentioned that you were discontinuing the gene expressional rate platform. I guess you could just give us how big of a revenue chunk was that? I would assume not much of your discontinued. Can you just give us I guess, do you need an array platform, do you need something in that area to basically go out?I am going to let Mark the answer the second half of that but the, this platform was not a material portion of our revenue, quite small. I don’t have the exact figures in front of me but it was quite small.And just to answer the second part we concluded. We didn’t need that, with the introduction in next generation sequencing. The 1700 at times, a niche in the market and there are some happy customers using out. We’ve decided to stop selling the readable, continue to sell the arrays for a while. But we actually look to the future in sort of what people doing that discovery area before we they go onto later validation with TaqMan.  We can do increasingly on using digital gene expression and actually do some of the applications better way we can get to law a transcript level more sensitive analysis. Particularly in some of the areas like microRNAs we’re not able to see those microRNAs on an array basis at form. We can see them on TaqMan and then we can see them on next generation sequencing. So we concluded strategically we would fill that with a solid platform.Okay and when you look at the TaqMan platform and there’s competition coming out from people that have been micro politic platform that you’re multiplexing. I guess could you just talk about what developments you see in your real time PCR business in terms of new instrumentation? I mean you have things to be competitive answer for the second platform?We believe we do. We’re not ready to share it fully yet. You know we don’t have a policy to share all the new products as its coming out. But we continue to look at, how do we leverage essentially it goes by the question earlier. This huge content we have in this capability for the TaqMan assays, they’re very, very fast. We have a great asset there in that consumable trail. And also the customers who’re using that; how do we look at different formats, form factors; you see it using in different flake well formats and micro plates, and coding rates. The different form factors that we’re looking at and you will see us continue to develop that and show things as we go through the year.Thank you very much.Our final question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson of J.P Morgan. Please proceed.Yes hi, can you hear me? Thank you. Given that in some of the discussions today revolved around Agin Core [ph] and Ambion, I am just wondering with the focus on cash being on share buybacks how you deeliminate this environment?I think, its Mark CK and I’ll take a portion of it. The level indebtedness right now is not only high. We certainly have substantial capital rating capability if there were an acquisition opportunity you wanted to pursue. And I don’t see that changing. We can only get the shares in so fast because of restrictions on how quickly we can buy them in the market. We obviously executed the transaction with Morgan Stanley we get the big slug of front that we will, when that opportunity is completed, we will continue that. But we’ll also be generating some standard cash flow during that period of time. So we have intentionally designed this program such that we would have sufficient capital or resources, pursue an acquisition if we wanted to. Mark do you want to tell how [inaudible] adds to that?Yes, I think strategically we regard both those examples, Ambion and Angi Core great example. So in the Angi Core case, we saw the market coming, we went out and surveyed14 different technologies. We poured a pretty early stage company and technology we look back to what we did in 8 form posted in June. And then in 15 months we have done a great job in R&D and commercializing that, improving the performance, making it robust, innovating along the way as I said improving where results reach to the point today. So we feel pretty good about that and the capability that we now have. We wanted to repeat for the right the opportunity. Similarly with Ambion what we’ve now done is integrated with both, the back office wit our ELP systems; but also the sales. The way we are doing right that is very specific applications work closes as you see. From sample prayer, I think you were the back end. So strategically it’s been a great fit for us and growing very well and both of those I think is good examples and interested as we continue to look strategically for similar continuities for us.And we have the capability to do one of those right now if we needed to.Okay. Mark if I could probe a little bit more on your comment from the sample prep around solid? It’s encouraging because the emulsion PCR is not going to be necessarily cumbersome or an overly cumbersome step for some of the smaller labs. If we kind of think about where those sample prep times could get down to, is it fair to ask you to kind of speculate where they can do over the next year to 2? I mean can they get down to 1.5 2 days or below?Yes we’re intending to focus rather than on that time on the throughput and the data.  Because I think there is lot of debate on, sort of the time but in reality what the costumer is asking is for is, okay how much data? What is the project and experimental I’m going to get done in that time and how mapable? There are a lot of back end borrowing from Matics [ph] challenges. So we focused on also just the software and the running time and the back end side. So, it really depends on the length of the run and in terms of what you’re trying to do. And so, that’s where we focused. Certainly as we go forward you’ll see improvements in all aspects of it and how we support the back end of the buyer and informatics, the two flow cells we’ve introduced now doubles the capacity, there’s on screen monitoring, the computer on the system saves a lot of time for some competitive systems that take time to pull the data off the system. So there’s a number of things you got to look at not just the sample prep when you look at sort of end to end running time here.And are you getting you know fairly good feedback on the informatics side, this is something that seems to be just within the industry. An area that people are increasingly focused on. And obviously it’s very early on in the adoption cycle but, how do we think about the informatics, are there hurdles or challenges over the next year?Yes, we got great feedback from the decision we made to go open source with this and we shared with the community and have been. We had a soft jamboree here in Foster City in July. All these software programmers came in and really enjoyed writing code on data analysis for the software. So, that’s what’s really helping us as we put the systems out in the community. Already we’re out there and customers have been writing software to help finalize the data which is a key issue considering you’re generating so much amount of data and to make sure it’s really mapable data back to the reference notes.Okay. In terms of just the logistics of the ramp, I mean are you planning to add reps or how do you think about maybe SG&A head side additions?Yes we think we got the right sales organization and support and service already in the field. A lot of experienced people so, we don’t imagine. It’s more just a dedication to people than an additional resource as we need to write here.The dollars will be re-deployed for these kinds of things not incremental.Okay and then finally one for Laura if she is still on. On the mass spec business we’ve seen pretty strong growth within the industry on HPLC and I know historically that you have products there but it hasn’t been a huge focus area. Are your thoughts, have they changed at all around HPLC, is there any thought that you may like to expand that portfolio or how do you view that opportunity?Yes Tycho. We’ve certainly given that careful consideration. That’s not something, that’s not our strategy, that’s part of our business. From the standpoint that we’ve been, and I think you’re aware of this, we’ve always been open LC and we will control and directly interface and integrate our multiple LC providers. And so the customer gets to choose which LC that they would like to put on the front end of our mass spec and that’s been a very successful strategy for us and will continue to be so.Okay great, thank you very much.I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Dworkin for this little portion of today’s call.Yes thank you. Moving to the second half of our call today, Tony White will make introductory remarks about Celera and then Celera President Kathy Ordoñez will review the Celera business. Also on the call today for the Q&A portion are other Celera and Berkeley HeartLab executives as David Speechly, Senior Director for Investor Relations for Celera. And very quickly for those who may have just joined us this morning, please note that during the call we will be making forward-looking statements about the Company’s businesses. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties relating to our businesses and corporate structure. These are referred to in the releases issued this morning and in our filings with the SEC. Tony?Thank you Peter, and good morning everyone again. I’m encouraged with the progress the business has made. As Celera has been moving towards profitability, we have looked at options that would reduce Celera’s reliance on other parties in the achievement of its business goals and performance, and allow it to improve its market presence and expand its product lines. The two acquisitions that we recently announced represent progress for Celera in this respect as the business now assumes greater control of its own destiny. The acquisition of Berkeley HeartLab provides Celera with direct access to the diagnostic marketplace and to the physicians and patients it serves. And providing the much needed commercial infrastructure to bring its new cardiovascular genetic tests to the American market through a strong team of people dedicated to the cardiovascular disease secondary prevention market with expertise in sales, marketing, reimbursement and cardiovascular disease management. Similarly, the acquisition of Atria Genetics is expected to contribute to Celera’s objective of providing high margin products with accretive value in a market that is complementary to ours. Atria has a line of HLA testing products that are used for identifying potential donors in the matching process for bone marrow transplantation. As our new genetic discoveries translate into potential new genetic tests and are combined with new capabilities and opportunities around these two acquisitions, we’re confident that our growth and development will continue throughout this fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier in the call, in August, we announced that the Applera Board of Directors has retained Morgan Stanley to explore possible alternatives to the Company’s basing tracking stock structure. And while a final decision has not been made related to this complex analysis, efforts to-date indicate a preference towards dissolving the current structure and creating separate publicly traded companies for Applied Biosystems and Celera. And we intend to update shareholders as the analysis is completed and the decision is finalized. The analysis is complex because Morgan Stanley is analyzing and reporting to the Board on all structural alternatives, together with the anticipated consequences of each. The Board will process that analysis into a final decision based on the best interests of all shareholders. The process for unwinding a tracking stock into two separate stocks typically takes something on the order of a year or more, but our goal is to finalize and execute any decision by our fiscal year-end, which is June 30, 2008. No assurances can be given that the Board will ultimately authorize such a transaction or that, if authorized; such a transaction will be consummated. I’ll now hand it over to Kathy Ordoñez who will discuss Celera in more detail. Kathy?Thank you Tony and good morning everyone. This has been a very productive period for us with a number of positive developments, including the acquisition of Berkeley HeartLab, or BHL, and the acquisition of Atria Genetics. Our scientists continued to publish their discoveries in peer-reviewed journals and our pharmacogenomics program gained traction with an oncology collaboration with Merck. We’re pleased to record profitable results for the first time in Celera’s history due, in part, to the achievement of a drug development license milestone by Merck and the resale of a small molecule drug development program. Our key activities this past quarter reflect two core strategic objectives: first to continue our delivery of products and services that support personalized disease management, and second, to position Celera to have more autonomy and direct access to customers outside the alliance with Abbott. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of BHL, which exemplifies execution on these strategic objectives. This transaction allows us to leverage our assets and the breadth of our product mix toward long-term growth and the creation of shareholder value. It provides value to Celera in a number of ways, not only in terms of market access, commercial infrastructure and accretion to earnings, but also by providing opportunities for Celera to more rapidly commercialize new tests and technologies, and to gain economies of scale and improve its margins as a consequence of the vertical integration with BHL’s laboratory service business. Additionally, some of BHL’s test offerings may form the foundation for future Celera IVD products. BHL’s business model is based on personalizing cardiovascular disease management. Their field-based clinical educators work in concert with the physicians they serve to use results derived from BHL’s tests to develop and monitor the effectiveness of personalized treatment regimens for exercise, diet, stress reduction and therapy compliance for the patients they serve. We currently have 5 cardiovascular tests in development with the most near-term a molecular test designed to optimize statin therapy in those individuals carrying a certain gene variant that conveys elevated risk for a cardiac event. Some of these data have either been accepted while others are under review for publication, and we anticipate the presentation and publication of these data at key cardiovascular meetings and in peer-reviewed journals this quarter. This genetic test for “statin benefit” is expected to be commercialized by BHL during the second half of fiscal 2008. Another cardiovascular test slated for commercialization in the coming months identifies certain individuals who would most benefit from aspirin therapy. Last week, we published data in Genetics in Medicine on the identification of a Genetic Risk Score, or GRS, for Coronary Heart Disease, which is an important conceptual first step in the demonstration of its clinical utility. This new test along with other GRS tests in development for stroke and thrombosis are targeted for commercialization during fiscal 2009. While the acquisition of Atria gives us direct access to the important niche market area of tissue typing in transplantation and the bone marrow registry markets, it also provides a means of potentially expanding the development of new personalized disease management products and services for the immunogenetics and autoimmunity fields. This past quarter, Celera received FDA clearance on its test for cystic fibrosis that is performed on an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencing analyzer. We have a next generation CF test moving forward in development and are working with customers to determine the priority of commercialization for these two product offerings. I’d like to take a moment to discuss end-user sales of products that are part of the alliance with Abbott, which is an important component of our business. For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, total end-user alliance sales were $24.9 million compared to $25.3 million in the prior year quarter. This was a challenging quarter for products within the alliance and the corresponding end-user sales. There were somewhat difficult year-over-year comparisons linked to the variability of orders and a large order in Russia in the prior year quarter, coupled with reduced cystic fibrosis ASR sales as a result of inventory reduction and, we believe, reduced reagent utilization due to test re-optimization, by a major customer in the U.S. this last quarter. Another contributor to the decline in end-user revenues this quarter versus the prior year quarter was the removal of the HCV genotyping ASRs due to an injunction against the sales of these products by Abbott, which was issued in the Innogenetics litigation. However, we were encouraged with the sustained penetration of the m2000 system in its existing markets in this last quarter, and this system continues to contribute to end-user sales. As part of their third quarter 2007 earnings last week, Abbott reported that they “have placed nearly 400 systems and continue to expand their presence, including the recent approval in China”. The growth in the installed base highlights the favorable adoption and market acceptance of the system since its launch over 2 years ago. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we believe the Abbott-Celera alliance now has m2000 placements in approximately 30 percent of our target market of around 1,000 laboratories. This excludes those laboratories that are predominantly offering home-brew assays, are focused on blood screening applications, or are too small or remote to add substantial revenue generation potential. Increased sales of fragile X and ASRs for factor V, factor II and MTHFR also contributed to end-user sales from new products in the alliance during the quarter. We were also encouraged by the progress that Merck described recently concerning the advancement of the orally available, highly selective inhibitor of the cathepsin K enzyme into a Phase III clinical trial as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. We’re pleased to have made a contribution to Merck’s program for this important disease indication. If this candidate, or others developed under the cathepsin K collaboration are advanced further toward commercialization, Celera will potentially receive additional milestone payments and royalties on net sales from Merck. Overall, we had a successful first quarter as we continued to build a firm foundation upon which to expand our product and services portfolio. The current fiscal year holds much promise as we plan to integrate BHL and Atria into the business and continue to expand revenues and move the business into profitability on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of the fiscal year. In line with this and as previously articulated, we rebalanced our R&D investments by shifting funding from discovery to development, and we curtailed our proteomics-based target discovery and validation activities, while we continue to fund diagnostic proteomics-based work. With all the developments over the past quarter, Celera is better focused and prepared to deliver on the promise of personalized disease management through its diagnostic test and service offerings, with a strong business profile for the future. Now, Dennis Winger will make a few comments regarding the financial results for Celera and our financial outlook for fiscal 2008.Thank you, Kathy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Celera reported a net profit of $700,000, or $0.01 per share, due to factors outlined in today’s press release, compared to a net loss of $7.1 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The first quarter share of a damage award in continuing litigation between Abbott Laboratories, Celera’s alliance, and Innogenetics took place in the prior quarter. Reported revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 increased $5.9 million to $16.1 million, compared to $10.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The first quarter fiscal 2008 results included $7.4 million of net revenues related to certain licensing payments, the achievement by Merck of a drug development milestone, and the resale of a small molecule program. Also contributing to the increase in reported revenues were higher royalties. The increase in reported revenues was partially offset by a lower equalization payment from Abbott compared to the prior year period. In the recent quarter, R&D expenses decreased by $2.5 million compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to reduced spending in proteomics discovery efforts. SG&A expenses increased by approximately $900,000 in the last quarter compared to the prior year quarter, due to increased expenses related to the review of Applera’s corporate structure. Celera ended the recent quarter with cash and short-term investments of approximately $548 million, down about $13 million in the quarter. The level of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was impacted by the timing of the collection of licensing and milestone payments recorded in the quarter, as well as the equalization payment from Abbott received at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The guidance that we can provide for Celera for fiscal 2008 is as follows. Total reported revenues are anticipated to be a $135 million to a $145 million. Reported R&D expenses are anticipated to be a $45 million to $50 million, and SG&A expenses are anticipated to be $70 million - $75 million. Celera anticipates that it will be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for the second half of fiscal 2008. Amortization of intangibles relating to the Berkeley Heart Lab and Atria Genetics acquisitions and restructuring charges, which are excluded from the of non-GAAP earnings per share, are expected to be between $0.07 and $0.09 per share for the remainder of the fiscal year. The total impact of FAS 123R, which is stock based compensation in fiscal 2008, is expected to be approximately $7 million, with an EPS impact of approximately $0.06. For fiscal 2008 Celera expects to spend approximate $220 million to $230 million on the acquisitions of both Heart Lab and 3 A Genetic including all transaction costs. For our currently anticipated to commit over $320 million to $330 million in cash and sugar test investments. The group believes it’s outlook and financial performance could be affected by a number of factors and other risks and uncertainties outlined in today’s press and in our filings with the SEC. Fee timer [ph] reflects manager current outlook so it does not have any untoward intention to occupy the level and plans to revisit the outlook for it’s business shown in one big quarter from financial results are announced. We will now be happy to take your questions, Silvara [ph]. Question and Answer[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Peter Larsen of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceedAll you could add some more color on the guidance, the change you have given in the guidance. Does that reflect any change in expectation for the corn molecular business or is it just the delta coming from Berkley and Attrea [ph]?First of all the guidance that Denis described reflects the combination of the three businesses, the Attrea, BHL and the original Celera business, where there has not been a substantial change in expectations.Okay. Thank you and then one of you can talk through any of the… is there anything left in the legacy pipeline of drugs at Celera that could be sold in the next year or so?Well it’s a complex question, let me answer it this way. As you know we have a number of small molecule assets that were partnered last spring and summer during 2006 and those assets are moving forward and we don’t expect to have additional partnering of small molecule assets. On the other hand we have a number of cancer targets that we have validated on to our prodiomics effort and we have an ongoing program to continue to partner those assets.Okay, thank you and then on the M-2000. I wonder if you could just add color on… because any slow down in Europe or the U.S. in placements of the boxes?They start dated the average review with us a few week ago, the progress in Europe continues to be very strong. Placements have sort of reached a steady state… rate of development and they are gaining market share very nicely there. The up take of real time technology here in the United States overall has been a little bit slower than we expected. The time to close the count is taking longer here in the United States than it has been the situation outside the United States. On the other hand Abbot has reported that where they have gone head to head versus the Roche crowbar taskman system, they are wining accounts more than they are losing accounts so they are doing very well in terms of gaining market share from a competitive perspective.Okay, that’s good to hear and then just finally on the staffing benefit test? Is that can expose to there to more FDA IVDA like risk or… how you are thinking about that, going forward?Well our initial plans for the staff and benefit test is to bring it up to the laboratory developed test at Berkeley Heart lab. We targeting to do that during the third quarter of the current fiscal year on a limited basis initially and then expand that once to get some market feedback. This is a test for simple flip and so based on our understanding of the current IVDMI guidelines, it would be subject to that sort of registration process. On the other hand I should say that it has always been Celera’s view that as a test like this becomes standard affair. It should undergo FDA review and since we would intend… we do intend to make this test available as an IVD kit ultimately and hyphens it to other laboratories. Our expectation is that we would as we gain more experience with the test, take it into clinical trials and put it in front of the FDA.Okay thank you so much Kathy. I will get back in the phone.Our next question will come from the line of Bill Cork of Piper Jaffray. Please proceedHi guys, Dave Clair here for Bill. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I appreciate the breakout of the Applera Alliance revenue in the press release. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more cover on profitability trends for the alliance and you have also mentioned lower equalization payment. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the change year-over-year?John S. the VP finance will address that question. John S. Ostaszewski – Vice President and Treasurer Yes the equalization pan on the quarter was about $2.1 million so that’s  down a little bit mostly due to the relative level of expenses between the two companies in the quarter.Look, we are not in a position to talk about the profitability of the alliance under our agreement with Abbot, so no deal, Dave.Okay, you mentioned that Berkley was growing solid double-digits with EBIT margins higher than 17%. Can you talk about your expectations going forward for the business and any color you want to give on kind of historical gross margin, SG&A, R&D would be greatly appreciated?I am going to jump in here. We are not going to be breaking out that business top level will be title [ph] so I don’t know what we have. I\\'ve always gone with that but I just want to make sure the group here understands we cannot do this.One other anomaly and looking at the combined business of course is that our strategy to commercialize the Celera new genetic tests through Berkeley Heart lab and so the resultant financials are actually the combination of the two businesses.We will be disclosing in our SEC filings some historical financial measurement. Berkley Heart was still in the process of preparing it but you will see that in our illuminative financial disclosures, historical financials and Berkley Heart can be SEC binds that we will file.But going forward there’s a number of things that is going to vary from that. One is the level of investment we are going to make in expanding that business. We haven’t disclosed that and probably won’t. As Kathy mentioned the integration of some of our other tests into that revenue stream will make a difference. Bringing in house manufacturing on some of the tests that got might also be something that will affect the financials of it so... so I just caution you that the historical financials are not going to be a great indicator but a lot of the details that you’re looking at.But a critical issue is that a critical comment I should make is that we remain very, very optimistic about the future potential for this business which was a driving factor in the acquisition along with the fact that we now have a clear certified laboratory to commercialize our new genetic test.Yes and I guess what I’m trying to say is that we\\'re going to invest about grow our product portfolio within that framework and also grow that framework.Okay. Great I appreciate that. And then on a $0.07 to $0.09 acquisition and restructuring charges. Is that…can we expect the bulk of that in kind of the second quarter or is it going to be spread out or… ?The bulk of that is amortization expenses and that will take place, it takes place a flat amount over each quarter going forward. That will be an ongoing charge for the, for Celera going… the restructuring charges which is not the bulk of that will take place in probably in both quarters actually.Okay. And how about the M2000 I know you mentioned that there is like a 400 installed base and and any kind of clarity on a U.S. O U.S. put there?Abbot has not broken that out but of course based on the time in the market and the comment that I made that the overall uptake of real time technology here in the U.S. is slower than it had been in Europe. The bulk of instruments are in the European marketplace.Okay. Thank you.Our next question will come from the line of Bruce Kreamer of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.Hi good afternoon. Kathy I’m sorry I missed that… will you, you won’t be breaking out BHL revenue specifically going forward. Is that right?That’s not our expect. We do not expect to break out Berkley Heart lab revenues going forward and part of the reason for that has to do with the crossover in reagent revenues coming from new tests that are sourced from Celera. So there we’ll actually, as soon as possible actually, be a blurring between revenues between Berkley Heart lab and Celera.So I know you typically don’t like to comment on end user sales levels going forward but when you do break it out in the forward quarters well… so should we assume that Berkley will drop into that end user number? Then is that the obvious conclusion.No the way we\\'re planning to report revenues going forward is the aggregate reported revenue figure for Celera including Berkley heart lab and then separately from that we will report end user revenues through the alliance so that you can see the development of the alliance activities separately.I see. And then just quickly on Attrea this again is a sort of visual question. I know its small but so no impact on that, that alliance sales number but higher equalization payments is that how I would think about it?Well the Attrea product sales are currently captured as part of the alliance end user revenues. However our share of value from those Attrea sales will now increase and the associated reported revenues for Celera will increase as a result of this acquisition.And then, just I guess thinking about the quarter from 30,000 feet. I guess I would describe the end user revenues as a weak side. Would it be fair to characterize your performance in the quarter as, if you would agree there is a weakness, is really on the alliance product and of the things not the other parts of the portfolio?Well that’s correct, I mean lets look at the overall performance in the quarter in total. Alliance end user sales were light and they were light of relative to a year ago the same quarter partly because of a very large shipment of M2000 related materials to Russia. On top of that as we pointed out in the comments that I made we had reduced cystic fibriosis sales are due to an inventory reduction and we believe possibly a re-optimization of the utilization of reagents by one major customer. So we were disappointed in the overall end user alliance sale despite the fact we are pleased with the uptake of the M2000 system. Now on the other hand we were profitable for the quarter and that was driven in part by two small molecule payments. One associated with the Cossesten K program with Mercke and secondly the resale of another small molecule program which I think underscores the quality of the science at Celera and that we were able to get back this program and very rapidly turn it around and sell it to another party because of the quality of the science. So it was an unusual quarter and those results speak for themselves.And as you mentioned CF I’m just curious on your opinion. Do you think having a clear test going forward means that that sales line. You could actually see some acceleration? See up revenues?If I look at the marketplace in general, there are two others CF’s products that have been cleared by FDA and the clearance of those products have not materially impacted the market dynamics so unfortunately I have to say the answer to your question is probably no. We suppliers go through a tremendous amount of work and expense to take our product through FDA and as we sit today it doesn’t seem to have a material impact on their success in the market place.Okay. I know this is a lot of questions just kind of on the… I guess the details but I am also curious about Siemens and real time PCR. Any guidance at all as to how we should model the $ 24 million over ten quarters with it. Should we presume its smooth or is that just not a good assumption ?Well, it’s relatively smooth. YesOkay. And then just philosophically I’m struggling a little bit with thinking about giving this license obviously to another infectious disease competitor. I guess what can you talk a little about that, how do you feel about that arrangement and the fact and that Siemens obviously could be a further competitor of yours going forward.So that is a very good question, because its an issue that we struggled with and thought about a great deal at Fulera and alternately we recognize that these real time instrument patents are due to expire in 2011 and 2012 and so the ability to get value from them will be diminished substantially by that time and so it comes down to a difficult business decision of essentially enabling a competitor while we have a very substantial head start and strong up take with the M2000 but trying to do that in a way that we can maximize the value that we take from this IP portfolio.Okay and one last from me just to be clear the R&D and SG&A guidance in the press release those dollar amounts are inclusive of Faz123?That’s correct, they are. Yes.Alright, thank you.Our next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin, of UBS.Derik, you are back.I’m back yes. Kathy or Denis is there any particular seasonality to the Berkeley HeartLab [inaudible]?I’d like Frank Ruderman, President of Berkeley HeartLab to answer that question for us.Yes, typically there is. There is a slow down in the summer months which would be July, August, may be a little bit of June because of vacations and typically there’s a little bit of more aggressive growth in the fall in the October, November, December primarily because of the insurance deductible and patients having meet the deductibles and trying to use up certain insurance benefits during that period and we typically see that the first quarter of the year I have to reorient my thinking because of the change in FY but the Solera Q3 would typically look in terms of samples like the previous quarter it would look like the Solera Q2.That’s very helpful. Thank you very much. I know you don’t want to give any comments on margins or something like that, but could you give us without specific numbers but I mean could you just point us into some sort of general direction like the cost of sales?Well with the cost of sales, Derik, I think there’s a chance you could calculate it actually with the margins.I was trying to be cute, I hear you.FYI, that’s a great financial mind there, Derik. Get right to the bottom of that. So no unfortunately we are not going to be able to give you that information. They did say we will disclose some and we haven’t got some historical financial information on Berkeley in our SEC filings.But I should pointed out you know as I did earlier that number is going to be changing you know. We have some ideas about how to make that margin actually improve so stay tuned.But not to imply that’s a negative margin. It’s just actually a very dynamic situation as we put the two businesses together and go through the vertical integration that I described and so I think Derik you are going to be able to get a good sense of the profile of the business as we report the combined Solera results over the coming quarters.I just want to extrapolate the historical for too long.I wasn’t planning on doing that. It has a big impact in terms of the level of profitability that’s all. So up on those lines I mean you know are you also going to provide some color on the tax situation?I’m sorry the take on Berkeley Heart?I mean you are obviously your tax rates are going up as well on this as well. I mean, does Green Berkeley HeartLabs give you some color on how it’s going to change the overall tax situation?We have given some guidance on the tax rate but Berkeley Hearts not going to have any impact on the tax rates.All right. Kathy as you look at some of the developments over the last week you saw that the D code is introducing its own audio test and you’ve seen help in getting approval for their test and recommendations. Can you talk about where your products are and how they stack up against the competition there?Yes, we believe that we have a much broader cardiovascular portfolio than any one else which is part of the reason for the strategy of the acquisition with Berkeley HeartLab we are very advanced with the stat and benefit test. We have moved that to the front of the queue simply because we are so excited about it. We have other tests that look at the risk profile for early on set cardiovascular disease which we understand is the space that D code is looking at. We have multiple markers there and we feel that we are going to be in a very competitive position. On the breast cancer front, on the other hand, I have to say that genomic health is substantially ahead of us. They have done a very, very good job in commercializing their gene expression test for breast cancer and the recommendation that we saw this week to my understanding is the endorsement of the use of gene expression profiling methods in breast cancer management so it points to the GHI tests we think that alternately this will pertain to additional tests as well. On the other hand we are making very good progress with our breast cancer test and John Sinskey, our VP of Research, could you give us a quick update on where that stands in terms of utilization?Thanks Kathy, you know our last communication with Life Core, they indicated to us that they are completing the validation and transfer of that technology into molecular oncology laboratory.And we have a, what I consider to be an excellent publication under peer review. It has been under peer review for a lot longer than we would have liked but that’s the way sometimes these review processes go and we have additional laboratories that are seeking access to this test method as well and so our hope is that we will have multiple offerings of this test available not only here in the United States but in Europe and Japan as well and its our belief at Solera that this test does require review by FDA through the IDMBA process alternately and we are working with Lab Core and we will work with other licensees to support that activity. I have not seen that with genomic health. I’m not sure what they are planning to do in that regard.Okay. That’s very helpful. And could you just talk a little bit about the, what’s going as far as the tests coming. Some changes going on?Stacy [inaudible], could you answer that question?Yes sure. As you know we licensed a test of Special Pay which is now part of Quest. The uptake with the test has been light, but however we are advancing our findings in two parallel paths. First there are a number of studies that are ongoing that further demonstrate the clinical utility and our understanding of the biology of our discoveries. Some of those will be presented at the upcoming AASOB meeting in November. And in parallel with that we are in discussions for commercialization with several labs in the U.S. and outside, major reference lab in the Unites States, in Europe and in Japan as well. Towards broader commercialization. Kevin was talking about the agreement that you have with Specialty that would… it wasn’t an exclusive agreement.No, it was not.Kathy, I have to say, I am little bit disappointed in terms of seeing the growth of the core diagnostic business, I guess, you know, it certainly seems to be taking a little bit longer to get all these things up and running and moving. I guess, how confident are you in your ability to relegate guidance that would be at about $55 million this year for the core business. How confident are you in you ability to deliver that given what you’ve seen right now, I mean you’ve heard there’s been slowing and delays and things.Well, Denis described our re-faded guidance that incorporates those results. But as I said earlier, we do not expect a material deviation from our original guidance. We had, as you point out, Derek, and I said earlier, we had a weak quarter as it pertains to end user sales, particularly on a comparative basis because of the loss of the HCB geno typing due to the injunction, the Russian tender sales, which by the way the Russian tender has been renewed so we are expecting positive results from the Russian tender, so sales are very lumpy on a quarter to quarter basis. And then the situation with the inventory reduction. So it was a disappointing quarter from end user sales perspective, but the organic growth of the business, particularly the end 2000 we remained very confident about.Thank you.Our next question will come from the line of Amit Nagpal of [inaudible]. Please proceed.Hi, can you hear me?Yeah we can hear you. Thank you. My question, you mention that the uptake of real-time technology in the U.S. has been slower than expected. Can you give us some perspective on what the primary source of push back is from the customers and help us understand why the sales lead time is longer in the U.S. versus Europe where has been a pretty rapid uptake. That’s my first question. My second question is can you comment on where you stand on expanding the test menu for M2000 in the United Sates, particularly gonorrhea?The overall uptake of real time technology, not just the end 2000 had been slower here in the United Sates on an account by account basis than in Europe and It appears to be just a dynamic of the approval process in the independent clinical laboratories and in hospitals. The decisions in Europe are often driven on a more scientific basis whereas the decisions here in the United Sates tend to be a little bit more financially driven. And requiring sign offs from many different levels, committees et cetera. So I think it’s just the nature of the dynamics in the two markets. Relative to your question to chlamydia and gonorrhea, menu availability on the M2000. The expectation is that that product will hopefully will be cleared by FDA, and available by the end of this fiscal year.So by the end of this fiscal year. Can you comment on where the pricing for chlamydia and gonorrhea has been committed or where the clinical trial stands, and can you also update us on the hepatitis B regulatory status?I am reluctant to talk about the status of the 510K because I don’t know what Abit has said about that publicly. But they have confirmed that they are expecting the 510K clearance on the CTNG test by the end of the fiscal year. Other tests, are available as analyzed specifically agents for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Currently now in the United States and now all five tests, HIV, HCB, HBB, viral load, chlamydia and gonorrhea are available Europe and in countries that recognize the CE mark.Maybe it’s a higher level question, Kathy, and just in terms of trying to understand, sounds like there is a bureaucratic process that just makes the sales lead time longer. And that’s understandable. Can you just help us understand, are there other sources of push back on M2000 relative to Takman? Will the expansion of the approved test menu really drive adoption? What are the things that, you’ve mentioned that you’re optimistic. Help us understand the specific points that lead to that optimism.From my personal perspective, Roche has an advantage in that they are the incumbent in most of these sales, they have leading market share as it pertains to the viral assays. So it’s a question of going into the account and displacing Roche. In most cases the Abbot system has prevailed. And in fact on the HIV assay, which is the primary assay here in the United States, the lead assay. More and more customers are now recognizing the importance of being able to detect the rarer sub types of the HIV virus. Abbot is doing a very good job of getting the message out to the HIV treating positions about that putting pressure on the laboratories to consider that as part of the decision process. And as more papers are published comparing results from the two systems we continue to be encourage that scientifically and in terms of workflow, customers prefer the M2000 over the Takman system.  But in very situation we are dealing with the the Roche incumbency, and the fact that Roche is the leading provider of products to the IBD market.All right thanks a lot. This concludes the question and answer portion of today’s conference. I will turn it back to Mr. Dworkin for any closing remarks. Sir?Thank you all in the audience for participating in the call today. Reminder that management remarks will be posted within the hour on our website and the audio replay will be available later today using the numbers listed in today’s press release. Thank you.'}"
